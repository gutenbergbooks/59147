<p>The interest which centers around the early years of settlement, when
what is now the lovely region of Central New York was a wilderness of
woods, streams, lakes, cataracts and rugged hills, is perennial; and in the
fierce Iroquois, the dreaded Six Nations, the half savage white ranger, the
colonial trooper, the resolute settler, the true forest women, the romance
writer finds almost exhaustless material for the construction of his historic
stories. Of the writers in this field of fiction Mr. Hamilton is well
known as a master. He gives such pictures of forest life, such clear-cut
portraits of forest men, as render his creations intensely interesting and
attractive.</p>

<p>This last work of his hand is one of impressive merit, and will greatly
delight the lovers of forest romances.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE MYSTERIOUS RESCUE.</span></h2>


<p>The wind was howling over the prairie, with a sharp,
penetrating power, while a few feathery flashes eddying
through the air, showed that although it was the season of
spring, yet in this elevated region of the Far West, there was
scarcely the first premonition of its breath.</p>

<p>The night was closing in, and the vast peaks of the Black
Hills, that had loomed up white and grand in the distance, were
gradually fading from view until they merged into the thickly
gathering gloom, while the blasts that whirled the snow in
blinding drifts about their tops, came moaning and sweeping
over the bleak prairie, as if searching for some one to inclose
in its icy grasp, and to strangle out of life.</p>

<p>Now and then the desolate howl of the mountain wolf,
came borne on the wind, adding to the gloomy desolation
of the scene, while the dark, swarming multitude of buffaloes
hurried over the frozen ground, as if fearful of being caught
in the chilling blast. It was a bad night to be lost upon the
prairie.</p>

<p>Is there no one abroad to-night?</p>

<p>From the grove of hardy cottonwood yonder, a starlike
point of light suddenly flashes out upon the night. Surely
that is the light of some hunter’s camp-fire.</p>

<p>A party of emigrants have halted for the night, and this
is the first camp-fire that has been started, for it is not only
cold, but there is cooking to be done, and a fire is indispensable.</p>

<p>The emigrant party numbers some twenty men, a half-dozen
women, and about double that number of children.
They are on their way to Oregon, and have penetrated thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
far without encountering any obstacle worth noting, although
for days they had been journeying through the very heart of
the Indian country.</p>

<p>Among the party was a man named Fred Hammond, who
had joined it more for the purpose of adventure than any
thing else. He was mounted on a magnificent black horse,
was an amateur hunter, and a general favorite with the company.</p>

<p>Among the latter was not a single experienced mountaineer
or prairie-man. They had secured the service of an old
man, who professed to be thoroughly acquainted with the overland
route to Oregon, but there was more than one who suspected
his knowledge and believed he was nothing but a
fraud.</p>

<p>Extremely good fortune had attended them thus far. They
had caught sight of numerous parties of Indians, and indeed
scarcely a day passed without something being seen of them.
They had exchanged shots at quite a distance, but no harm
had befallen the whites, and they had penetrated thus far on
their way to distant Oregon.</p>

<p>But Hammond and one or two of the members were filled
with misgiving. Through the day they had seen evidence of
an immense Indian party being in their vicinity, and they
feared the worst. It was with pain that they saw the huge
camp-fire kindled, and Hammond called his comrade, Beers,
to one side, and said, in his earnest voice:</p>

<p>“I tell you, things look darker than ever before.”</p>

<p>“So I think.”</p>

<p>“I believe we are followed by over a thousand Indians,
and they intend attacking us to-night.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“God only knows; I don’t like that camp-fire.”</p>

<p>“Let it burn for a short time; they don’t need it long, and
then it can be allowed to die out.”</p>

<p>“But it will betray our position.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose there is any means possible by which we
can conceal it?”</p>

<p>“Not entirely, but partly.”</p>

<p>As the night deepened it became of intense darkness.
There was no moon, and the sky was entirely overcast with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
clouds, so that there was scarcely any light at all. The few
flakes of snow that were whirling through the air had entirely
ceased, but the wind still whistled through the grove.</p>

<p>“There is a moon up there,” said Hammond, “and if the
clouds break away at all, we shall have enough light to guide
us on our way.”</p>

<p>On account of the danger, which all knew threatened them,
a number proposed that as soon as their animals had had sufficient
rest, they should move out of the timber and continue their
journey; but this was finally overruled, as they were not
only likely to go astray in the darkness, but the Indians could
easily find them, from the unavoidable noise made by their
wagons.</p>

<p>If attacked on the open prairie at night, they were entirely
at the mercy of their assailants, who could easily encircle and
tomahawk and shoot them all, while in the grove they could
make a fight with some prospect of success.</p>

<p>So it was prudently determined to remain where they
were.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour, when there was no imperative
necessity for a fire, it was allowed to slumber and finally die
out. The wagons were placed in a rude circle, with the
animals within, while the women and children, and such men
as were relieved from duty, sought their quarters for the night,
and soon silence rested upon all.</p>

<p>A double guard was set. Ten men were scattered around
the outer edge of the globe at regular distances from each
other, on the alert for the first indications of danger.</p>

<p>Beers and Hammond stood next to each other, and the
former finally left his station and took his position beside the
latter.</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” he muttered, by way of apology.
“When it’s so dark that you can’t see any thing, where’s the
good of straining your eyes? As we have got to depend on
our sense of hearing, we’ll help each other.”</p>

<p>The air was so sharp and keen that they had great difficulty
in keeping themselves comfortable. They dare not
stamp their feet or swing their arms, and such movements as
they made, were made with a stealth and caution that nearly
robbed them of all their virtue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of an hour the sky gave some signs of clearing.
It was somewhat lighter overhead, but still the earth below
was little benefited thereby. There was scarcely any variations
in the wind, although several fancied that it had somewhat
decreased.</p>

<p>Another hour passed drearily away, and then Beers suddenly
laid his hand on the arm of Hammond.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Hark!”</p>

<p>Borne to them on the wind came the distant but distinct
sound of a horse’s feet, as he galloped over the hard prairie.</p>

<p>The rapid clamp of the hoofs were heard for an instant,
and then the varying wind swept the sound away from their
ears, and all was still.</p>

<p>But in a moment they rallied out again with startling distinctness&mdash;then
grew fainter&mdash;died away and rung out once
more.</p>

<p>“Some one is riding fast,” said Beers.</p>

<p>“And he is coming this way,” added Hammond.</p>

<p>A few minutes convinced them of the truth. A single
horseman was riding at great speed over the prairie, and was
manifestly aiming straight for the grove where the emigrants
had halted for the night.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, all the sentinels had observed it by
this time, and there was great excitement among them. They
gathered about Hammond to receive his directions.</p>

<p>“Go back to your stations,” said he. “Keep your eyes and
ears open for others, whether they be mounted or afoot, and I
will attend to this one.”</p>

<p>His orders were obeyed, for he was looked upon as having
authority in this matter, and with an interest difficult to understand
they awaited the coming of the horseman.</p>

<p>As the latter came nearer, he seemed to be heading straight
for the point where Hammond and Beers were standing.</p>

<p>During the last few moments, the sky had cleared so rapidly
that objects could be distinguished for quite a distance, and
the two men strained their eyes through the gloom to catch
sight of the stranger.</p>

<p>“There he is,” whispered Hammond, as the dim outlines
of a horse was discovered through the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The horseman had reined his horse down to a walk, and
was advancing quite cautiously. He continued onward until
within a dozen feet of the two men, when he reined
up.</p>

<p>“Who comes there?” asked Hammond.</p>

<p>“A friend.”</p>

<p>“What do you seek?”</p>

<p>“You are in great danger, and I have come to warn you
of it.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” exclaimed Beers, in an undertone; “that
is a <em>woman</em>!”</p>

<p>Hammond had noticed the wondrously soft and musical
voice, and he now walked forward, so as to stand beside the
horse. The dim light showed that Beers spoke the truth; it
was a woman seated upon the horse.</p>

<p>“May I ask your name?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s hesitation, and then the female
answered:</p>

<p>“I am Lamora; and I speak the truth.”</p>

<p>“We do not doubt it,” responded the amazed Hammond.
“What is it you have to say?”</p>

<p>“A thousand Blackfeet warriors are coming down on this
grove, two or three hours before sunrise, and if you remain,
there will not be one who will escape alive.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Make ready as soon as possible and start westward. Let
there not be a moment’s delay, and you will be saved.”</p>

<p>“But they can follow us to-morrow, (if not to-night,) and attack
us by daylight.”</p>

<p>“They can, but they will not,” replied Lamora, with the greatest
earnestness. “This is a great war-party on their way
southward to fight the Cheyennes. They are to meet a long
ways off to-morrow; the Blackfeet have given themselves just
enough time to massacre you and your friends, if you remain
in this grove, as they expect you will; but if they come here
and do not find you, they will have no time to follow up your
wagons, and thus, you see, if you improve your time, you will
be saved.”</p>

<p>“Beers,” said Hammond, turning to the man beside him,
“rouse the men and have this thing done without a moment’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
lost time, while I make a few more inquiries of our unknown
friend.”</p>

<p>Beers darted away, and almost immediately was detected
the rapid moving to and fro, and the bustle of getting ready
to start.</p>

<p>“Your orders are being obeyed,” said Hammond, addressing
the lady, who still sat her horse beside him.</p>

<p>“It is well that they are,” she replied, with a sigh of relief;
“the Blackfeet know that you are encamped here, and
they have no reason to think you will not be here when they
are ready to strike.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where they are?”</p>

<p>“Over that ridge of hills, several miles to the northward.
They have been riding, throwing the tomahawk, and making
every preparation for the great battle which is to come off to-morrow
between them and the Cheyennes.”</p>

<p>“This, then, is only a diversion?”</p>

<p>“That is it; they naturally think that, as they find you in
their way, they may as well indulge in a little preliminary
practice.”</p>

<p>“We were fearing an attack, as we knew that there were
a large number of Indians in our vicinity, and we heard the
sound of your horse’s feet long before we heard you. Being
thus warned and prepared, could we not have made a successful
defense, with the shelter of these trees, which you probably
know are very numerous about us?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the instant answer of Lamora; “if there were
no more than a hundred Blackfeet, you might repel them; but
a thousand would overwhelm you. There are sounds of preparation
upon the part of your friends.”</p>

<p>“Yes; we shall soon be on the move.”</p>

<p>“Keep straight to the westward; there is now enough light
to prevent your going astray, and you will find, when daylight
comes, that Heaven has brought you out of all danger. Farewell!”</p>

<p>Ere Hammond could interpose, or even thank her, the horse
had wheeled about and was off on a gallop. Almost instantly,
he vanished in the darkness, and the rattle of his hoofs grew
fainter and fainter, until they, too, died out in the distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>Lamora</em>,” repeated the young man. “I surely have heard
that name pronounced by other lips than hers.</p>

<p>“Who is she? Where did she come from?</p>

<p>“She was sent by heaven, most assuredly.”</p>

<p>While conversing with the girl, Hammond had approached
her horse as near as possible, and had managed to gain a distinct
view of her face. There is something in the dim, misty
moonlight which softens the asperities even of the repulsive
countenance, but he was certain that the most beautiful creature
upon which he had ever looked was conversing with him.
Her half-civilized dress, and her wealth of flowing black hair,
partly assisted in her enchanting appearance; but the face itself
was one of unsurpassed loveliness.</p>

<p>The peculiar circumstances under which they encountered
gave Hammond an equally peculiar interest in her, and a pang
of disappointment went through his heart when he found that
he was standing alone, and that she had left him so abruptly.</p>

<p>But he had important matters in hand for the time, and he
gave his whole thought to them.</p>

<p>Every one was working with the energy of people who
were convinced that their lives depended upon the result.
The teams were harnessed, the wagons loaded up, and at the
end of half an hour the whole train moved out of the grove,
toward the west.</p>

<p>Before starting, men had ridden out on the prairie in every
direction, and returned with the announcement that nothing
could be heard of the Blackfeet, and all pressed forward with
the greatest vigor and determination.</p>

<p>With the passing of the immediate danger, the thoughts of
the strange woman who had befriended them returned to Fred
Hammond. He felt a powerful interest in her, and, as he was
riding beside the guide of the company, he turned to him
rather abruptly, and asked:</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard of Lamora?”</p>

<p>“Heard of her?” repeated the latter, in surprise; “wasn’t
I telling you all about her the other day?”</p>

<p>“So you were; I was sure I had heard her name before,
but I could not recollect from whom. Who is she?”</p>

<p>“She is a white girl, living with a tribe of Indians, somewhere
up north of us, and she has done many such things as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
this for the white people crossing the plains. I have heard of
her for years as doing the same thing.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a looking person is she?”</p>

<p>“Just the handsomest creature that ever lived! Wait till
you get a good look at her.”</p>

<p>Hammond was not long in finding that their guide knew
very little more regarding her than he had already told, although
he gossiped and chatted about her until daylight.</p>

<p>When light at last broke over the prairie, many eyes were
cast anxiously backward, but not a sign of the Indians was
visible. The warning of Lamora had saved them!</p>

<p>Fred Hammond could not drive the thoughts of this beautiful
being from his mind, and finally he determined that, as he
had joined the company for the sake of adventure, he would
turn back and seek adventures of the most romantic kind.</p>

<p>So, on the afternoon of this day, he quietly withdrew from
the company, and started at an easy gallop in the direction
that the guide had indicated led toward the home of the mysterious
and beautiful Lamora; and, leaving our hero for a
time to himself, we must now bestow our attention upon
others, who have a part to play in this narrative. <em>Love</em>, the
passion of our nature, will play the mischief with all of us,
and Fred Hammond was soon off on this great “love-chase”
of his life.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">WHAT IS IT?</span></h2>


<p>Black Tom and old Stebbins had a hard day’s ride of it,
and they drew the rein in a heavily-timbered grove, just as the
sun was setting, with the intention of camping there for the
night.</p>

<p>They were well up toward the Black Hills, in a country broken
with forest, hill and prairie, and interspersed with streams
of every size, from the rivulet and foaming cañon to the broad,
serenely-flowing river.</p>

<p>They were in a region infested with grizzly bears and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
fiercest of wild animals, and above all with the daring and
treacherous Blackfeet&mdash;those dreaded red-skins of the North-West,
with whom the hunters and trappers are compelled to
wage unceasing warfare, and who are more feared than any
tribe that the white men encounter.</p>

<p>So these veteran prairie-men proceeded with all their caution
and kept their senses on the alert for any “sign” of their old
enemies, who came down sometimes like the sweep of the
whirlwind, and who had the unpleasant trait, after being
thoroughly whipped, of not staying whipped.</p>

<p>Dismounting from their ponies, old Stebbins walked back to
the edge of the timber, and carefully made a circuit around it.
He was thus enabled to gain quite an extended view of the surrounding
prairie, although his view was broken and obstructed
in several places.</p>

<p>Tired and ravenously hungry as he was, he moved cautiously
and made his tour of observation as complete as it was possible
to make it. Finally he turned about and joined his companion,
who had kindled a good roaring camp-fire during his absence,
and had turned both horses loose to crop their supper
among the luxuriant grass and budding undergrowth of the
grove.</p>

<p>“Well, Steb., how do you find the horizon?” asked Black
Tom, who bore that soubriquet on account of his exceedingly
dark complexion.</p>

<p>“Cl’ar, as the sky above?”</p>

<p>“Nary a sign?”</p>

<p>“Yas&mdash;thar’s signs, but the sky is powerful cl’ar.”</p>

<p>This apparently contradictory answer requires a little explanation.
Old Stebbins had detected <em>signs</em> of Indians&mdash;indeed
had indubitable evidence that they were in the neighborhood;
but the signs which indicated this fact to them indicated still
further that the same Indians, or Blackfeet, as they undoubtedly
were, had no suspicion of the presence of white men. This,
therefore, disclosed a “clear sky” so far as the trappers were
directly concerned, although they were thus made aware that
there was a dark, threatening cloud low down in the horizon,
which might rise, and send forth its deadly lightning.</p>

<p>Looking to the westward, Stebbins saw a wooded ridge a
hundred rods or so distant, which shut off any further view in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that direction; but, about a half-mile beyond this, his keen
eyes detected the smoke of a camp-fire. It was very faintly
defined against the clear blue sky, but it was unmistakable, and
indicated that a party of Indians were encamped there.</p>

<p>Why, then, did Black Tom sit so unconcernedly upon the
ground, after hearing this announcement, and permit their fire
to burn so vigorously, when its ascending vapor might make
known to the Blackfeet what they did not even suspect?</p>

<p>Because night was closing around them, and ere the red-skins
would be likely to detect the suspicious sign, it would be concealed
in the gathering darkness&mdash;and the dense shrubbery effectually
shut out the blaze from any wanderers that might
venture that way.</p>

<p>As there was nothing at hand immediately to engage their
attention, the trappers, after gathering a goodly quantity of
fuel, reclined upon the ground, and leisurely smoked their pipes.</p>

<p>“Teddy is gone a powerful while,” remarked Tom, as he
looked up and saw that it was quite dark; “he can’t be as
hungry as we are.”</p>

<p>“He’s seed the sign&mdash;and he’s keerful&mdash;hello!”</p>

<p>At that instant, the report of a gun was heard, sounding
nearly in the direction of the Indian encampment. The trappers
listened a moment, and then Tom added, in the most indifferent
manner possible:</p>

<p>“Wonder ef that chap’s got throwed.”</p>

<p>“Hope not,” returned his companion, “fur ef he is we’ll
have to go to bed on an empty stomach, or scratch out, and
hunt up our supper for ourselves.”</p>

<p>The individual who had occasioned this remark was Teddy
O’Doherty, a rattling, jovial Irishman, who had got lost from
an emigrant train several years before, and in wandering over
the prairie fell into the hands of the trappers, with whom he
had consorted ever since.</p>

<p>He had spent enough time among the beaver-runs of the
north-west, to become quite an expert hunter; he had acquired
a certain degree of caution in his movements, but there still
remained a great deal of the rollicking, daredevil nature, which
was born in him, and he had already been engaged in several
desperate scrimmages with the red-skins, and the wonder was
that he had escaped death so long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Like a true Irishman, he dearly loved a row, and undoubtedly
he frequently “pitched into” a party of Indians, out of a
hankering for it, when prudence told him to keep a respectable
distance between him and his foes.</p>

<p>On this afternoon, when riding forward over the prairie, old
Stebbins indicated to him the grove where they proposed spending
the night, when the Irishman instantly demanded:</p>

<p>“And what is it yees are a-gwine to make yer sooper
upon?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to hunt up something,” replied Tom; “we’re
out of ven’son, and thar don’t seem to be any fish handy.”</p>

<p>“Do yees go ahead, and make yerselves aisy,” instantly
added Teddy. “I’ll make a sarcuit around the hill yonder,
jist as I used to sarcle around Bridget O’Moghlogoh’s cabin,
when I went a-coortin’, to decide whether to go down the
chimney or through the pig-stye in the parlor. Do yees rest
aisy, I say, and I’ll bring the sooper to yees.”</p>

<p>And with this merry good-by, he struck his wearied pony
into a gallop, and speedily disappeared over the ridge to which
reference has been already made, and the trappers passed on to
the grove, where we must spend a few minutes with them, before
following the fortunes of the Irishman, who speedily dove,
head foremost, into the most singular and astounding adventure
of his life.</p>

<p>The hunters listened some time for a return-shot or shout to
the gun, but none was heard.</p>

<p>“It was Teddy’s bull-dog,” said old Stebbins. “I know the
sound of that critter, for I’ve fired it often ’nough.”</p>

<p>“Wal, thar hain’t been any answer to it, as I guess it was
p’inted at some animile instead of red-skin.”</p>

<p>This seemed to be the conclusion of both, as they gave no
further thought to the absent member of their party.</p>

<p>It was a mild day in late summer, before the vegetation had
given any indication of the approaching cold season. The
hunters had ventured thus early into the trapping-grounds for
two reasons: one was to mislead the Blackfeet, who would be
looking for their coming a month or two later, and the other
reason will become apparent hereafter.</p>

<p>“To-morrow we’ll strike the trapping-grounds,” said old
Stebbins, in his careless manner, as he lazily whiffed his pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s two months yet afore we need set our traps,” said
Black Tom.</p>

<p>“That’ll give us plenty of time to find out all we want
to,” replied his companion.</p>

<p>“Yas,” added the other, somewhat significantly; “we’ll
l’arn whether thar’ll be any need of our ever settin’ them ag’in
or not.”</p>

<p>“Not quite that,” said old Stebbins, with a laugh and shake
of the head. “I don’t b’l’eve <em>that</em>.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” continued Black Tom, who seemed in the
best of spirits; “it looked powerful like it when we had to dig
out last spring.”</p>

<p>“It did, summat&mdash;”</p>

<p>“B’ars and beavers!” exclaimed Tom, suddenly coming to
the upright position, jerking his coonskin hat from his head,
and dashing it upon the ground, “don’t you remember,
Steb.?”</p>

<p>“Remember what?” demanded his companion, not a little
startled at his manner.</p>

<p>“It was right hyar that we see’d <em>that</em>!”</p>

<p>“See’d what?”</p>

<p>“Old Steb., you’re a thunderin’ fool!” replied Tom, with an
expression of disgust. “I guess you’re gettin’ childish. I,
s’pose, you don’t remember that&mdash;that&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;that
we see’d near hyar?”</p>

<p>“How did I furget it? How did we all forget it&mdash;Teddy,
too?”</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Stebbins recalled the creature to
which reference had been made. Unquestionably brave as
both of these men were, their appearance showed that they
were frightened. Their bronzed and scarred faces were pale,
and they looked into each other’s eyes in silence, both revolving
“terrible thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Right out thar,” said Stebbins, speaking in a terrified whisper,
and pointing toward the open prairie, over which they had
just ridden; “how was it that we wa’n’t on the look out fur
it?”</p>

<p>“Dunno, when we’ve been talkin’ ’bout it all the way. It’s
too bad that it should come right hyar&mdash;jest near the very
spot we’re after.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mebbe it’s gone away,” added Stebbins, speaking not his
belief, but his hope.</p>

<p>“It will be a powerful lucky thing for us, if it has.”</p>

<p>As frightened children huddle close together, around the evening
fire, at the thought of the dreadful ghost, so these two stern-featured
men, whose faces had never blanched when the
howls of the myriad red-skins, who were closing around them,
sounded in their ears, now instinctively sat closer together, and
looked off furtively in the darkness, as if in mortal dread of
some coming and appalling monster.</p>

<p>But this sudden exhibition of fear was mostly temporary in
its manifestations. As each clutched his trusty rifle, and recalled
the terrible weapon of which he was master, their confidence
almost, but not entirely, returned.</p>

<p>“If that thing <em>does</em> come,” finally spoke old Stebbins, in his
deliberate but emphatic manner, “and I can get the chance,
I’m going to put a rifle-ball into it, smash and clean.”</p>

<p>“S’posen it doesn’t hurt it.”</p>

<p>“That’s onpossible.”</p>

<p>“Dunno,” persisted Black Tom, “from what we’ve hearn
of it, they say it don’t mind our guns.”</p>

<p>“Ef it can stand a shot from <em>my</em> gun, then thar ain’t no
use in talking,” was the response of the old hunter.</p>

<p>“Don’t you mind what Stumpy Sam told us about it?” asked
Stebbins, some minutes afterward.</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear what he told <em>you</em>; you see’d him first.”</p>

<p>“It was two years ago, come the middle of trappin’ season,
when Sam said he and three other fellers see’d him. It
warn’t a great ways from hyar, and they war riding up one
side of a ridge, when jist as they reached the top they met the
<em>thing</em>, coming up t’other side. They had a good sight of it,
and the whole four fired right into it.”</p>

<p>“Wal?”</p>

<p>“It give a sort of a snuff, turned tail toward ’em, and
walked away, as though they hadn’t done nothin’ more nor
sneeze at it.”</p>

<p>“That’s Sam’s story,” replied Tom. “I allers b’l’eved he
told a thunderin’ lie about it, ’cause why, thar ain’t <em>no animile</em>
that could stand four rifle-bullets right into his face.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say,” assented Stebbins. “Sam and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
rest of them fellers must have been so scared, (though it
wouldn’t do to tell ’em so,) that they didn’t hit the critter at
all, and that’s what makes me kinder want to draw bead on
it, and see what it’ll do afterward.”</p>

<p>“But I say, Steb., now s’pose you do get a crack at it, and it
don’t make no difference at all; what then?”</p>

<p>“Why,” fairly whispered the old hunter, in his shuddering
earnestness, “then I’ll know it’s a <em>spook</em>!”</p>

<p>That was a dreaded word, for it touched the tender point
in a brave but ignorant man’s character. Strong in the face
of real, tangible danger, they were like children before a peril
which they could not comprehend.</p>

<p>Both of these hunters had sent their ounce of lead crashing
through the heart-strings of the buffalo and grizzly bear, a
hundred yards distant, and they were warranted in believing
that no living creature could face such “music” and live.</p>

<p>What, then, were they to think of any thing that could bid
defiance to their weapons? Was it not natural that they
should look upon it as something outside of the world in which
they lived&mdash;something to be dreaded, as the possessor in itself
of a power above and beyond theirs?</p>

<p>They had heard strange stories of a wonderful beast seen by
different hunters and trappers, who had visited this portion
of the Black Hills. Common report had placed it somewhat
further to the north-west, so that when the year before they
had caught a glimpse of it, in sight of the very grove where
they were then encamped, they had double cause for amazement.</p>

<p>They had placed these marvelous stories and rumors which
reached their ears in the same category, that listeners doubtless
often placed theirs, and believed they originated from an encounter
with some mis-shapen, malformed brute, that was no more to
be feared than the ordinary creatures to be looked for in these
wilds, at any time and by any one.</p>

<p>But there came a time when they were most completely
undeceived. The preceding spring, when they were returning
to the States, and they were heavily laden with furs and
peltries, they made their halt for the night in the same grove.
They were sitting around the fire, somewhat late at night, as
Teddy was sound asleep, when they heard a peculiar barking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sound, and both stole hastily out to the edge of the timber
to see what it meant.</p>

<p>As they did so, they saw <span class="smcap">IT</span> going leisurely toward the
ridge, its head being away, and its side partly toward them.
Both the hunters identified it on the instant. It was smaller
in size than the grizzly bear, but was unlike any creature that
either had ever seen. Its appearance, so far as they could
judge, allied very well with what they had heard.</p>

<p>It had an immense head, short, thick legs, that moved somewhat
clumsily over the ground, and a long, bushy tail, like a
squirrel, that was curled over its back, as is frequently seen
with that diminutive creature. But the most striking feature
about it was its color.</p>

<p>It was a clear night with a faint moon, so that the hunters
could not see clearly, but they distinguished the leopard-like
spots and zebra-like stripes, that dotted and encircled every
part of its head and legs, and on the impulse of the moment,
Black Tom raised his rifle and fired at it. He was pretty
certain his bullet struck, but if it actually did, the creature
paid not the least heed, but moved away at a leisurely gait, and
speedily vanished.</p>

<p>Such is an account of the first encounter with the fearful
nondescript, which, once seen, could never be forgotten. Since
then they had seen nothing of it, although they heard many
marvelous stories of it when they reached the settlements on
the border.</p>

<p>A full hour had passed since the report of Teddy’s gun,
and old Stebbins and Black Tom were conversing in their
hushed way, when they were startled by the sound of rapidly-approaching
footsteps, and they had scarcely time to look up,
when Teddy dashed up to them, panting and almost breathless.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded his friends, grasping their
rifles and starting to their feet.</p>

<p>“The divil! the divil! I’ve seen him! I shook hands
wid him, and he’s comin’!”</p>

<p>“Where? where?”</p>

<p>“There! there!” replied the appalled Irishman, pointing
and glancing toward the prairie. “He’s comin’; he’ll be here
in a minit! Blessed Virgin, protect me!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">TEDDY O’DOHERTY’S ENCOUNTERS.</span></h2>


<p>It will be remembered that upon the appearance of the
strange animal, during the preceding spring, one member of
the party, (Teddy O’Doherty,) was asleep, and failed to see it.</p>

<p>But he heard enough of it continually. It was described
and conjectured upon again and again in his hearing, until he
came to look upon it as an old acquaintance; but having never
set eyes upon it himself, he attached little credit to these
numerous accounts, and supposed it was a bear or something
similar.</p>

<p>“A pecoolyer-lookin’ critter, as everybody obsarved when
they viewed me; but a critter, fur all that, that nobody need be
afeard of.”</p>

<p>So, when a short distance from the camping-ground of his
friends, he left them and started in quest of the antelope,
he had no thought of the other dreaded creature that had
been seen in this region, and that made its home so near at
hand.</p>

<p>Passing over the ridge, he found himself in such a heavily-wooded
country, that he dismounted and continued his hunt on
foot. His horse was thus left but a short distance from the
camp, and the Irishman understood well enough that he would
not increase the distance.</p>

<p>The sun was low in the horizon, but, looking westward,
Teddy caught sight of the faint column of smoke that had
arrested the attempt of old Stebbins. He paused a moment
and looked earnestly toward it.</p>

<p>“Red naygurs,” he concluded, “and they’ve squatted down
rather close, as Bridget used to observe, when she sot on one
side the house in Tipperary, and I on t’other. I will go and
inthrodooce myself.”</p>

<p>The intervening ground was very favorable for a reconnoissance,
and he moved along with little fear of being discovered.
It was fully dark when he reached the strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
camp, where not a single person was visible; but a few minutes
examination showed that a large number of Blackfeet
Indians had encamped there, but all had been gone several
hours.</p>

<p>A little careful examination of the surrounding ground,
by means of a torch, showed further that they had mounted
their horses and gone due westward, exactly in the opposite
direction from their friends, and the very course they would
have desired them to take.</p>

<p>This was a pleasing discovery for Teddy, but he was reminded
that he had started out to procure a much-needed
supper for himself and friends, and that night had closed
around him without his having done so.</p>

<p>But good fortune awaited him. This was a country of
bountiful game, and the Blackfeet had evidently been feasting,
for they had left behind them such an abundance of
buffalo-meat and venison, that Teddy found no difficulty in
picking up an all-sufficiency for his friends.</p>

<p>To make the load as convenient, however, as possible, he
put his share within, making a hearty and enjoyable supper,
and made sure that he had secured to his back all that Stebbins
and Black Tom could dispose of, and then he started homeward.</p>

<p>In his explorations around the camp fire, he had given it
such a stirring up that it was burning vigorously, and threw
quite an extended circle of light though the surrounding
gloom.</p>

<p>Teddy was standing by the fire, looking in upon the embers,
and reflecting how good he felt after his dinner, when
it suddenly occurred to him that he was a fine target for any
foe that might be lurking in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The thought had scarcely crossed his mind, when he saw
something flickering before his eyes; he heard a whizz, and
knew on the instant that an arrow had missed his face by scarce
a hand’s breadth.</p>

<p>Instinctively he threw his head back, and then jumped
back in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Be the Vargin, but that’s a <em>leetle</em> too close, as me uncle
obsarved, when by mistake he shaved off his nose, instead
of the mustache on his chin. Begorra; if I kin only get
a chance at the spalpeen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>He understood from what direction the deadly missile had
come, although he could not tell how far away the Indian
stood that had fired it. The Irishman was now enveloped
in the gloom of the woods, and his self confidence returned.
The experience which had been his with the veteran prairie-men
had taught him to move over the ground with the
stealth and silence of the Blackfoot himself, and were he so
fortunate as to be approaching his treacherous foe, he was
certain there was no danger of his betraying himself.</p>

<p>“I’m moving as silent as a fairy,” he reflected; “it’s a
handy thrick fur a chap in my sitooation&mdash;bad luck to it!”</p>

<p>In the darkness his foot caught in a projecting root, and the
consequence was, Teddy was thrown forward flat upon his face.</p>

<p>“Bad luck to it!” he repeated, as he hastily scrambled to
his feet, “hilloa, there! hold on I say!”</p>

<p>He heard a hurried tramp, and in the gloom caught a flitting
glance of an Indian speeding rapidly away from him.</p>

<p>“Howld on, ye dirty coward!” called out the irate Teddy,
dashing after him, “howld on, I say, or I’ll bate ye, and I’ll
bate yees if ye do.”</p>

<p>It is hardly worth while to say that the Irishman’s command
was unheeded. The red-skin whisked away, like a flitting
phantom, and almost instantly vanished. Teddy pursued
him for a short distance, but he was not much of a runner,
and his pursuit could not result in any thing but a complete
failure.</p>

<p>He was not given time to aim and fire his gun. His “short
and decisive campaign” against the Blackfeet was a defeat!</p>

<p>“Bad luck to that rut!” he muttered, as he made his way
back to it; “it was all through that!”</p>

<p>He groped around until he discovered the scene of his mishap,
when he revenged himself by tearing and ripping the
mute offender to pieces.</p>

<p>“It was yees that saved a coward’s life!” he exclaimed, as
he finished his self-imposed task, “and yees shall niver do the
likes ag’in.”</p>

<p>It may be said that it takes a hungry man to appreciate the
same gnawing want in another, and so Teddy almost forgot
that he had a couple of friends, something over half a mile
distant, who were looking longingly for his coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“They kin wait as well as mesilf,” he concluded, when he
recalled the fact. “Thrue, I have a sooper within, and be
the same towken, their sooper is without&mdash;but, then, what’s
the difference?”</p>

<p>However, he concluded that, as the night was now quite
well advanced, there was no objection to his rejoining the
trappers, and so he started forward.</p>

<p>There was a moon above the tree-tops, and where the
country was open he had quite a clear view for a distance of
several rods; and, as he recollected very well the route taken
in his hunt, there was no fear of his losing his way.</p>

<p>As he moved along, he could see the dark line of the ridge
outlined against the sky beyond, and he knew that only a
short distance on the other side, his comrades were looking for
his coming.</p>

<p>Teddy had a pretty correct idea of the gastronomic capacity
of his friends, and so he had loaded himself down pretty
heavily with the plunder found around the Blackfoot camp-fire.
All that he carried was cooked and prepared, ready for
eating.</p>

<p>He was scarcely half-way to the ridge, when he became
sensible that he had a very heavy load upon his back; and,
coming across a large, flat rock, he sat down upon it for a few
minutes’ rest.</p>

<p>“Begorra, if the spalpeens ate all of that, it’ll do till they
raich the States ag’in. Hilloa, there!”</p>

<p>This exclamation was caused by the sight of a man walking
in a direction at right angles to his own, and only a rod or
two in advance. He was walking leisurely, like some one who
was returning from a wearisome hunt; and, what surprised
Teddy, he was certainly a white man, rather young in years.</p>

<p>“Hilloa, I say!” called out the Irishman, again.</p>

<p>The stranger abruptly paused, and looked inquiringly toward
him.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it ye want?”</p>

<p>“Who the blazes be yees?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as that concerns you,” replied the stranger,
resuming his walk, and almost immediately disappearing in
the darkness.</p>

<p>The exasperated Teddy shouted to him to hold on, calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
him a coward, and seeking by every means imaginable to
bring him back. Had it not been that he was so heavily
loaded, he would have sought to follow and bring him to
terms; but the Irishman scarcely had time to rise to his feet,
when the man had vanished.</p>

<p>“Jist me luck!” he growled, as he sunk back again to finish
his rest. “I once walked siven miles to attind the wake of
Micky McMaghaghoghmoghlan, and whin I got there, found
he hadn’t died at all; and so, whin I was felicytaterin’ mesilf
on a fight wid this impudent spalpeen, he walks away, widout
exchanging a crack of the head wid me. Bad luck to him!
but I’ll have a muss wid somebody, if it’s wid old Stebbins or
Black Tom, and then I’ll be sure to get whopped, which is
better nor not fightin’ at all, at all.”</p>

<p>Teddy was about to resume his walk, when a peculiar sound,
something like the bark of a dog, caught his ear.</p>

<p>“What the dooce is that?” he exclaimed, staring about
him. “Who’s got dogs in this part of the world?”</p>

<p>His inquiry was answered by a sight of the creature itself.
He saw a large, clumsy-looking animal, with an immense head
and a most frightful-looking body, spotted and striped in the
most terrible manner, coming straight toward him.</p>

<p>“Begorra! but it’s the divil,” was the Irishman’s conclusion,
as he sat like one transfixed, staring at it. “It’s the divil himself,
dressed up in his bist soot, and going to the circus.”</p>

<p>It can not be said that Teddy was particularly frightened,
for he had his loaded gun in his possession, and with that he
was justified in having confidence in his powers of attack and
defense.</p>

<p>But suddenly, he recalled the stories he had heard of the
strange monster that haunted this portion of the North-West.</p>

<p>“It’s worse nor the divil,” he muttered, “fur it’s <em>that</em>, be
the howly Vargin!”</p>

<p>This discovery caused the Irishman some little trepidation,
but, at the same time, he was rather pleased that he was about
to have an opportunity to try his gun upon it.</p>

<p>Indeed, as the nameless beast continued his leisurely advance,
his appearance would have struck terror into the heart
of any one. The fantastic, extraordinary hue of its body and
legs, the immense tail curved over the back, and its ponderous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
build, were such that, once seen, no one ever could forget
them.</p>

<p>“An’ they say he ates min whole,” thought Teddy, as he
silently drew his rifle around in front of him. “His head is
big enough, be the powers! Wonder, now, if he isn’t a shark
that’s immigrating from the Atlantic to the Pacific.”</p>

<p>The fearful brute continued his leisurely advance, as if he
saw not, or, at least, cared not for the man who was seated almost
in his path. His course was such that, if unchanged for
a few seconds longer, would lead him about a rod to one side
of the amazed hunter.</p>

<p>The latter, as may well be supposed, scrutinized it most
sharply as it approached, and under the dim light of the moon,
he had a good opportunity to notice its characteristics.</p>

<p>Its head and body have already been described; its short,
dumpy legs very much resembled those of an elephant, while,
barring the trunk and tusks, its head was not very dissimilar.
It had the same immense palm-leaf like ears; but its mouth
looked like that of an alligator&mdash;so that its cannibal propensities
did not seem so unlikely after all.</p>

<p>It moved heavily and somewhat awkwardly, but its appearance
was that of an animal of prodigious strength, much
the superior of the famed grizzly bear, and a creature to be
shunned in a hand-to-hand encounter.</p>

<p>The idea that would naturally suggest itself upon a glance
at this strange creature, would be that it was a cross, combining
in itself the characteristics of several animals; but men
who had spent years in the West, and understood its native inhabitants
thoroughly, declared that such could not be the case.
Its build and appearance was unlike any thing that had ever
been seen in these parts. It was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sin generis</i>, and unlike any
thing else.</p>

<p>Some believed that it belonged to an extinct race; probably
to the era of the mastodon, and other monsters whose remains
are found in the earth; that by some strange providence, it
had escaped the destruction of its kind, and still wandered over
the world, like a lost sheep, looking in vain for its fold&mdash;the
last and the least of its race.</p>

<p>But this was a fantastic theory&mdash;so utterly impossible, that
it deserves no more than simple reference here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>There certainly were some established facts regarding this
monster which are utterly unaccountable. It had been fired
at again and again, by the most skillful hunters, and yet never
gave the slightest evidence of being hurt. Bullets that would
have bored their way through the hide of the rhinoceros, and
torn on through bone and muscle to the seat of life, seemed to
glance aside, as harmless as the tiny hailstones.</p>

<p>There was many a man, certainly, who had tried his weapon
upon it, and it still walked the earth to defy their skill and
efforts. There were hunters who said they had seen it bite a man
in two at one mouthful&mdash;just as the alligator or shark serve the
swimmer that ventures into their domain.</p>

<p>But while we have drifted into this digression, the situation
of Teddy O’Doherty has become more and more critical. He
sat with his gun in hand, with his eyes fixed upon the brute,
waiting for the opportunity to fire.</p>

<p>He had determined that if it headed straight toward him,
he would be polite enough to step aside, for <em>that</em> certainly was
not the antagonist to engage in a close fight; but it did not
swerve an inch from its path.</p>

<p>And walking thus, it passed about a rod to the left of Teddy,
who cautiously raised his gun and took aim.</p>

<p>What better opportunity was possible? It was so close that
he could have tossed his hat upon it, and was turned broad-side
toward him. If he could stand a shot then, surely he was
invulnerable to powder and bullet.</p>

<p>The hunter aimed directly behind the fore leg&mdash;that spot
which is the vital one to the most dreaded animal, and through
which the messenger of death makes his way without challenge.
He waited until the foot was thrust forward, and his aim was
absolutely certain.</p>

<p>The next instant his piece was discharged.</p>

<p>“Thar! be the Virgin, if that doesn’t fotch yees&mdash;”</p>

<p>Heavens! what did he hear and see?</p>

<p>He heard that same bark-like cry that had first caught his
ear, and saw the brute coming straight toward him!</p>

<p>Flesh and blood could not stand it; and with a howl of
terror, Teddy broke in a run for the camp. A few furious
bounds carried him to the bottom of the ridge, when his bad
luck overtook him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Glancing back, he saw the dreadful beast close upon him,
galloping along like the cat, when frolicking with its prey.
The load upon the back of the fugitive made him somewhat
awkward in his movements, and he stumbled and fell flat upon
his face. Ere he could rise, his foe was upon him!</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE DEMON AT THE CAMP-FIRE.</span></h2>


<p>Teddy gave up; he believed it was all over with him. Lying
flat on his face, he committed himself to heaven, and
waited for the beast to devour him.</p>

<p>Ugh! what a galvanic shudder shook him, as he heard its
smothered bark repeated, and felt its hideous nose glide along
his body! He felt it thrust beneath his breast, and then the
beast gave a lunge, like a hog when rooting, as if seeking to
turn him over on his back.</p>

<p>“No; be the powers, you don’t,” muttered Teddy. “I’m
not the chap that’s goin’ to turn over and see mesilf ate up.”</p>

<p>So, instead of turning, he remained flat upon his face, sliding
a few inches over the ground.</p>

<p>With a low growl of rage the monster repeated the attempt,
and his victim resisted him as before.</p>

<p>Teddy O’Doherty was brave, almost to fearlessness, but this
was too much even for him; and, at that point, he swooned
away into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>He probably remained in that condition but a short time.
When his senses came back to him, he was lying on his back,
with his face upturned to the moon. For a few moments, he
was naturally enough bewildered, and he lay motionless until
it all came back to him. Then he half whispered.</p>

<p>“<em>I’m dead and ate up!</em> how qu’ar it saams! I never knew
it felt this way. Yis, Teddy, you’re ate up!”</p>

<p>Gradually a doubt began to filter through his mind, and he
moved his hands about his person to see whether he was all
there. His load of provisions were shoved from his back, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
lay to one side, while he soon discovered that he was all there
and had suffered no physical harm!</p>

<p>Yes; the consciousness finally came to the terrified Irishman
that he was still in the land of the living. There was
not a wound or scratch upon his person, nor had the food
been disturbed, except by the mere act of displacement.</p>

<p>“Begorrah, Teddy O’Doherty, but it’s your own mither’s
son that ye be,” he soliloquized, not a little delighted; “but it’s
so different that ye feel, that ye’ll have to have somebody to
inthrodooce ye to yersilf. I wonder ef that ould craythur is
watching fur me.”</p>

<p>The Celt cautiously raised his head and looked about him.
There was nothing to be seen of the dreaded beast, look in
whatever direction he chose.</p>

<p>“Ef it wasn’t me that wasn’t me, but the baast, then it’s mesilf
that would be afther ating Teddy O’Doherty, and be the same
towken that I haven’t, I’m sartin the baast isn’t human,”
concluded Teddy, as he slowly clambered to his feet and furtively
glanced about him.</p>

<p>“Thank the good Lord, and the Vargin, that I’m alive!”
he exclaimed, gratefully, as he began picking up his provisions
again. “I s’pose the craythur wasn’t hungry, and whin he
was pokin’ his nose about me, it’s likely that he was thrying
to pick me pockets.”</p>

<p>Filled with wonder at his unaccountable escape from the
monster, the Celt begun his walk homeward again. He
reached and passed up and over the ridge without discovering
any thing of his dreaded enemy. Turning aside, he
found his horse quietly grazing where he had left him, and,
deeming him as safe there as any where else, he permitted him
to remain.</p>

<p>He was now within a short distance of the camp of his
friends, and was proceeding in his quiet manner, when a cold
thrill ran through him at the sound of that appalling bark.</p>

<p>Turning his head, he saw the beast on a full gallop, coming
down the ridge, and scarcely a hundred feet distant.</p>

<p>It was like the explosion of a bombshell behind Teddy, and
he broke into a wild run, bounding through the timber and
up to the camp-fire with the exclamations that have been recorded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>A horde of mounted Blackfeet, or a dozen grizzly bears,
could not have created greater consternation. Old Stebbins
and Black Tom, as will be remembered, had been conversing
about the mysterious creature, and their minds were full of
it.</p>

<p>Instantly they leaped to their feet, and stared out in the
gloom.</p>

<p>“Whar is he?” demanded Black Tom.</p>

<p>“Close behint me,” replied the terrified Irishman, running
around to the opposite side of the camp-fire.</p>

<p>“I don’t see him&mdash;b’ars and bufflers! thar he comes!”</p>

<p>Unconsciously the two trappers took their position side by
side. They had stood by each other in many fearful and
dangerous scenes, and neither would desert the other at this
time.</p>

<p>As Tom spoke, both he and his companion caught sight
of the hideous brute, coming through the bushes straight toward
them. It was walking quite slowly, and at intervals
gave forth that peculiar bark, which had a strange, cavernous
sound.</p>

<p>Viewed from the front, its appearance was appalling in the
extreme. Its head was of vast size, its mouth in latitude resembled
that of the alligator. As it advanced, the firelight
shone full in its face, and curiously enough neither of the
hunters could discern any thing that resembled eyes, although
of course it was sentient.</p>

<p>Very naturally the two trappers had determined to send their
messengers into his eyes, satisfied that, if there was nothing
superhuman in its make, it could not prove invulnerable to
such an attack; but they were unexpectedly deprived of this
great advantage, seeing which Black Tom whispered to his
companion:</p>

<p>“Aim under the throat, and maybe we’ll reach its heart.”</p>

<p>No more than a dozen feet separated men and beast, when
the former simultaneously drew their guns to their shoulders,
took a quick but sure aim and fired.</p>

<p>They might as well have buried their bullets in the solid
oak beside them, for all the good that was accomplished.
That peculiar bark of the brute may have been caused by the
sound as well as by the bullet of the gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>It stood a moment, as if looking steadily at the men, and
then resumed its advance.</p>

<p>This was too much, and with a howl of terror the three
men scattered and were up the nearest saplings in a twinkling.
Here they felt a certain degree of safety, as it was hardly
probable that such a constructed creature could “climb a
tree.”</p>

<p>“But if he chooses,” replied Teddy, from his perch in reply
to this remark, “he kin pull up the tree by its ruts, and
crack our heads togither.”</p>

<p>Finding himself master of the situation, the mysterious
brute took every thing very quietly. Teddy having fastened
the meat to his back, had not removed it upon climbing the
tree, so that there was nothing on the ground for it to devour;
and the trappers were too veteran hunters to fail to carry
their weapons with them.</p>

<p>The camp-fire had just been heaped up with fuel, and was
now roaring and crackling furiously. The brute seemed to
contemplate it a few minutes in quiet wonderment, and then
he sat down upon his haunches like a bear, and looked fixedly
at the blaze.</p>

<p>“Look at the spalpeen!” called out Teddy. “Did ye ever
see sich impudence. He looks as if he owned the grove and
us too.”</p>

<p>“That’s jest ’bout what he does own,” replied Black Tom,
with grim humor.</p>

<p>“He reminds mesilf, whin I used to sit down in the pratie
patch at home, in Tipperary, and think I owned the whole of
it, and so I would, if it hadn’t been that anuther chap claimed
it.”</p>

<p>During these few minutes, all three of the men had been
reloading their guns, as best they could in their circumscribed
position. When ready it was arranged that they should discharge
their pieces together, at the head of the monster.</p>

<p>This was done, and incredible as it may seem, without result.
Struck it undoubtedly was, for it gave a slight
twitch with its head, as a dog will do, when pestered with a
fly, but it certainly was no more harmed than it would have
been by such an insect.</p>

<p>At so short a distance, with such a plain target, it would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
been impossible for the bullets to miss their mark, so that no
refuge from the difficulty could be taken in that supposition.</p>

<p>The brute sat motionless a moment, with his gaze upon the
burning faggots, and then rising from his sitting position,
walked around to the other side of the fire, and took his seat directly
under the sapling which was the refuge of Teddy O’Doherty.</p>

<p>“Ye dirthy blaguard, ye needn’t come there,” he growled,
as he looked down at him; “ye’re a dirthy dog, as me Bridget
used to obsarve, affectionately, when she saw me comin’ in her
shanty av Soonday avening.”</p>

<p>“He’s fell in love with you,” remarked Black Tom, who
thought he could afford to jest a little, so long as the brute
made no active demonstrations against him.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s turned watch-dog,” said Stebbins, “and is going
to keep the other spooks away.”</p>

<p>It may be stated that the demonstration which the trappers
had just received of the invulnerability of the mysterious creature
was complete in every respect. They would have staked any
thing and every thing that it could have stood without flinching
before a battery of columbiads. Under these circumstances,
therefore, they did not deem it wise to waste any more
powder in firing upon it.</p>

<p>So they reserved their ammunition, and made themselves as
comfortable as possible in their elevated position, waiting until
it should take it into its head to depart.</p>

<p>“S’pose he stays here a week or two?” said Stebbins.</p>

<p>“Then we must do the same.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t we think of the fire?” muttered Black Tom.</p>

<p>“What did yer want to think ’bout <em>that</em>?” asked old
Stebbins.</p>

<p>“If he don’t care fur rifle-balls, it’s likely he’s afeard of that.
If I had only slammed a lot of fire in his face, he’d left.”</p>

<p>“Better not try it,” returned the elder.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t noways likely it would have hurt him, and he might
have cotched you up and slammed you in the fire.”</p>

<p>This was a fearful supposition, and all three shuddered at
the thought of the brute venting his spite in such a manner.</p>

<p>As it was certain that nothing could be done in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
vanquishing the monster, the question now was as to how long
he would remain. While he was present, no one could entertain
any idea of descending, and if he should take it into his
head to spend several days there, there certainly was reason to
fear the most serious consequences.</p>

<p>An hour passed and still the brute sat as motionless as a
statue. Being several yards from the camp-fire, its fitful light
gave him a most terrible appearance. The trio kept up a
pointless conversation for a long time, Teddy gradually withdrawing
from it, until he became silent altogether.</p>

<p>No notice was taken of this fact for some time, until suddenly
Black Tom became suspicious and called his name.
Receiving no response, he exclaimed, to old Stebbins:</p>

<p>“Bufflers and Blackfeet! he’s goin’ to sleep!”</p>

<p>“If he does he’s gone, sure. Wake him up!”</p>

<p>“Teddy! Teddy!” called Tom, “wake up, or you never
will.”</p>

<p>“Aoogh! what&mdash;”</p>

<p>Too late. The Irishman, in his bewilderment, did not
comprehend his perilous position, and making an uneasy movement,
lost his hold and fell!</p>

<p>And fell in such a manner that he struck full length upon
the back of the frightful brute!</p>

<p>A shudder of horror shook the trappers, as they looked
down upon what they regarded the certain death of their comrade,
who gave a shriek of terror as he rolled like a log helpless
to the ground.</p>

<p>The brute started, uttered his sharp, bark-like cry, and
then bolted away and vanished in the darkness, without offering
to harm the man who lay helpless at his feet.</p>

<p>“Begorra! but he’s a gintleman, as Micky Dunn obsarved
of the man that cracked his crown. That’s the sicind time
he’s give me the go-by, and the nixt time he does it we’ll shake
hands and swear we’re friends.”</p>

<p>“It beats thunder!” exclaimed old Stebbins, who was now
prepared to believe Teddy’s account of his extraordinary meeting
with this animal.</p>

<p>“It can’t be that he don’t eat men,” said Black Tom, “for
Stumpy Sam said he see’d it chaw up one of their men.”</p>

<p>“I guess he don’t like Irishmen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s meself that thinks he does,” retorted Teddy, “for he’s
tr’ated me like a gintleman all the way through.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t yer going to climb up ag’in?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“What’s the use, when it’s more comfortable here, as
Micky McFee remarked when he was axed to come out of the
gutter.”</p>

<p>The Irishman made no attempt to re-climb the tree, although
he looked carefully about in every direction in quest of the
dreaded creature.</p>

<p>Some fifteen minutes passed and nothing was seen or heard
of their dreaded foe, when the hunters, who were excessively
hungry, cautiously descended to the ground again.</p>

<p>The first thing done was to replenish the fire, and they determined
that if the brute should reappear, they would try the
effect of dashing some of the brands in his face.</p>

<p>The next proceeding was to attack the provisions which
Teddy had brought back with him, and with such ravenous
appetites, they were not long in “throwing themselves outside”
of an immense quantity of food.</p>

<p>By this time night was well advanced, but there was no
thought of sleep upon the part of any one, excepting Teddy
O’Doherty. He had acted as sentinel the night before, and
soon became drowsy and stupid.</p>

<p>As he was entitled to rest, he was permitted to stretch out
near the fire, with his blanket gathered about him, when he
speedily sunk off into utter unconsciousness.</p>

<p>There was some apprehension regarding the horses, and
after a while Tom stole away from the fire into the grove
to see whether they had been disturbed. Having cropped
their full of the rich herbage they were found asleep, as
free from alarm as was the sleeping Teddy O’Doherty.</p>

<p>Added to the terror inspired by the very appearance of
the dreaded creature, was that of amazement at the unaccountable
manner in which it had acted toward the Irishman.
Twice it had had him completely in its power, and yet had
not harmed a hair of his head.</p>

<p>Why was this? Was it possible that it had really
formed a sort of partiality toward Teddy? Such things have
been known among wild animals, but it was hardly possible
in this case. What, then, could be the explanation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>These were conundrums which the trappers asked themselves
repeatedly, and which as repeatedly they were compelled
to “give up.”</p>

<p>The night wore gradually away, but nothing more was
seen of the terrible monster. The camp-fire was kept burning
brightly, and the hunters listened attentively for sounds
that might betray his approach.</p>

<p>Once or twice a faint rustling of the leaves caused them
to start and look affrightedly out in the gloom, but they
caught no glimpse of the frightful beast. Accustomed as the
hunters were to all manner of exposure and deprivation of
sleep and rest, they found no difficulty in keeping their senses
about them, even when their bodies were not in motion.</p>

<p>It was a relief to them when the gray mist of morning
began stealing through the wood, and they saw the light of
another day illuminating wood and prairie.</p>

<p>They seemed to feel scarcely any desire for sleep, and
Tom aroused Teddy by giving him a vigorous kick.</p>

<p>“Come, git up! that beast is looking for you!”</p>

<p>“Let him look!” replied Teddy, as he roused himself.
“As long as he behaves himself so well I’ll be glad to see
him.”</p>

<p>There remained enough of the provisions brought by Teddy
to make a substantial breakfast, after which the horses were
brought up and saddled, and in a short time the trappers were
on their way toward the north-west.</p>

<p>They had still a short distance to travel before reaching
their destination, and while they are thus engaged we will
take occasion to refer to a few matters necessary to a full
understanding of the incidents that follow.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">IN THE CANON.</span></h2>


<p>As we have intimated in another place, old Stebbins and
Black Tom were veteran trappers who had been in the “profession”
a goodly number of years. Both men had families
in Independence, Missouri; and, as the incidents we are giving
are supposed to have occurred fully a score of years ago, it
will be seen that they were engaged in a most dangerous
business.</p>

<p>But they had grown so accustomed to its hardships and
perils, that when they left home in each autumn, they felt
scarcely different from the traveling-agent, who starts upon
his tour of several weeks. Both were strongly attached to
their wives and children, and were free from the rough, careless
habits of dissipation that so often distinguish such men.</p>

<p>In the spring preceding the opening of our story, the two
trappers and Teddy O’Doherty were returning homeward
with a plentiful supply of peltries, having three horses, besides
those they rode, laden down with them, and they were
in the highest spirits at the success of their winter’s work.
Reaching a point a short distance from where we saw them
encamped, they halted for the night.</p>

<p>Nothing unusual occurred during the night; but in the
morning, when old Stebbins went to a small rivulet near by
to drink, he discovered a number of shining particles in
the sand, which he instantly recognized as gold. He instituted
an examination, and found that in several places it was
quite abundant, showing that it would amply repay working.
He returned to the camp with the information, when Black
Tom came in with confirmatory evidence. Near the spot
where his comrade had leaned down to drink, he had accidentally
loosened a large, flat stone, which he overturned and
found any quantity of the auriferous particles. Putting this
and that together, the trio came to the conclusion that they
had accidentally struck a “gold mine,” and that with care
and industry they could easily make their fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The question was then discussed whether they should remain
where they were, and follow up the prize that was so nearly
in their grasp. Teddy O’Doherty was strongly in favor of it,
but the two hunters had families who would look anxiously for
them if they overstaid their time, and they had a load of peltries,
very valuable, that made the “bird in the hand,” and
they were anxious to dispose of them before returning upon
any other undertaking.</p>

<p>So, after a careful consideration of the matter, it was decided
to press on toward the States, to dispose of their stock,
and then return to prosecute their search for gold. This was
done; but the return of the hunters was much delayed by the
sickness of a child of old Stebbins, who was not considered
out of danger for several months. Finally, however, it recovered
entirely, and the three set out upon what was to
prove a most eventful journey.</p>

<p>By this time it was late in summer, and would soon be time
for trapping operations to begin. But the three came without
their pack-horses, fully determined to devote all their energies
to the hunting for gold.</p>

<p>There was the one “lion in their path,” the dreaded monster,
to which we have made such frequent reference, and which,
it will be remembered, was seen by them on their return trip
homeward, at the time of the discovery of gold.</p>

<p>Had old Stebbins and Black Tom been single men, it is
very doubtful whether the attraction of gold would have been
sufficient to lead them into a region that was known to contain
such an anomaly; but the prospect of placing their families
in easy circumstances for life drew them onward, and
thus we find them prosecuting their search for the precious
metal in the face of such a hideous monster.</p>

<p>It is not often that a man finds a short and easy road to
wealth; and, besides the ever-threatening peril of the beast,
they made the unwelcome discovery that there were people in
this region ahead of them.</p>

<p>This proved that our friends were not alone in their knowledge
of the presence of gold in this secluded part of the
world, and it looked no ways improbable that they might encounter
serious opposition and trouble from them.</p>

<p>Thus they had the four-legged terror, the Blackfeet, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
unknown white men to encounter before they could hope to
go back to the United States with “coffers filled.”</p>

<p>It will be recollected that on the night of Teddy O’Doherty’s
first encounter with the brute, he saw and spoke to a strange
man that passed near him&mdash;a stranger who was on foot,
and who refused to pause and make known his identity to
him.</p>

<p>The presence of this white man, they believed, indicated
the presence of others, and it thus behooved our friends to use
the utmost circumspection in their movements. They were
scarcely a half day’s journey from their destination, and it
lacked yet an hour or two of noon, when they reined up their
horses for what they intended should be the long halt.</p>

<p>Here was capital hunting-grounds, and it was only a few
miles beyond this where it was better, and where they had
spent several years in the business. There were hills and
mountains, rivers, streams, cañons, prairies, woods, and the
most romantic diversification of land; there were abundant
places where they could approach within a dozen feet of a foe,
without seeing him.</p>

<p>They knew the ground well, and the wonder was that as
gold seemed to be all about them in such abundance, they had
never detected the indications of it before.</p>

<p>A secluded place was discovered, where their horses were
turned loose to roam free and get themselves in prime condition,
while their owners were seeking to put their pockets in
the same healthy state.</p>

<p>In a rude, cavern-like structure, made by the jumbling of
immense masses of rock together in a remote period of the
world, the trappers placed their saddles and luggage, while,
carrying their rides and spades, they set out upon a prospecting
tour.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that ar’ critter is anywhar ’bout yer,” remarked
Black Tom, as they moved away together.</p>

<p>“I don’t,” replied old Stebbins.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“’Cause yonder he is this very minute.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the old hunter pointed upward to the top of
a cliff, full five hundred feet above them, and several hundred
yards distant. There, in full relief against the blue sky, stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the beast, his ungainly body so strangely striped and ringed,
and its appearance so singular as to be almost indescribable.</p>

<p>For a minute the three men looked at it in silence, and
then Teddy O’Doherty removed his coonskin cap and made
a low obeisance.</p>

<p>“What’s that for?” asked Black Tom.</p>

<p>“I s’lute him, jist as the gintry in Tipperary used to s’lute me
when they saw me ridin’ by on me own jackass, that belonged
to another man. The baast is a gintleman, so long as he uses
me in the shtyle of last night.”</p>

<p>“You’d better keep cl’ar of him, so long as you can.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t bother him, nor persoom too much on his good
nature.”</p>

<p>“’Sh! thar he goes.”</p>

<p>From his high elevation came the faint sound of his peculiar
bark, and then the brute turned about, and was immediately
lost to view.</p>

<p>“Thar’s no tellin’ whar he’ll next turn up,” said Stebbins,
as the three moved forward again.</p>

<p>“No; and I don’t believe when we meet him again, that
we’ll get off so easy as before,” replied Black Tom.</p>

<p>The gold-hunters were now in a sort of deep cañon or rent
in the mountain, through which ran a small stream of icy-clear
water. It was this same rivulet that had displayed the
golden particles to old Stebbins, but it was at a point higher
up, before it entered into this wild region, and it was now the
intention of the three to follow up the stream for a considerable
distance, searching it carefully for the same precious
metal that had drawn them hither.</p>

<p>In prospecting thus, it was evident that it was necessary to
keep a good look-out; and, as Teddy manifested such an
appreciation of the nameless brute, that task was deputized to
him, while the others were to scrutinize the bed of the small
stream for what had caused them to halt in this place.</p>

<p>For several hours the party made their way up the tiny
brook without discovering the first indications of gold; yet,
they were not discouraged by the fact, for they knew there
was plenty of it in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>They had almost reached the spot where they had seen it
a few months before, when Stebbins, who was slightly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
advance halted, and snuffed the air with the manner of one
who scented something suspicious.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Black Tom, failing to understand
what it meant.</p>

<p>“We’re near something dead&mdash;hello!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the old hunter pointed to a clump of bushes
that surmounted a mass of rocks and gravel, seemingly without
any soil to give them existence. From it a huge bird,
gorged almost to bursting, laboriously rose a few feet in the
air, and floated sluggishly down the cañon, a hundred yards
or so, when it landed upon a cliff, at a moderate elevation,
and then stepped heavily around, so as to face and watch the
men that had disturbed him.</p>

<p>“That’s whar it is,” said Tom, looking toward the bushes.</p>

<p>The next minute the three moved toward the spot indicated.
Their lives had accustomed them to many repulsive and terrible
scenes, but all were visibly shocked by what they saw.</p>

<p>It was a magnificently-formed Blackfoot warrior, lying flat
upon his back, while the bird had been tearing its meal from
his vitals. He had undoubtedly been dead several days, else
the odor would not have penetrated so far, but there was no
bullet-mark upon his person, so far as the three could see
without a more minute examination than any chose to make.</p>

<p>“What killed him?” asked Black Tom.</p>

<p>“The beast,” was the instant answer of Teddy.</p>

<p>“What makes you say that?” asked Tom, turning rather
sharply upon the Irishman.</p>

<p>“Look how his hid is broke in,” replied Teddy, as he
pointed downward. “Thar ar’ only two things that could
break it in that shtyle.”</p>

<p>“Wal, what are they?”</p>

<p>“A shillalegh or the baste; and, as there is no one prisent
that can wield the shillalegh but your humble servant, Teddy
O’Doherty, be the same towken it must have bin the baste.”</p>

<p>The trappers acquiesced in the decision of their companion,
and felt certain that the Blackfoot had been a victim to the
fury of the brute that had so terrified them. It was plain
that he had been struck a terrible blow on the head and face,
a blow that had crushed in his skull as though it were an
egg-shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Here there was a demonstration of what this fearful creature
could do, when excited by anger, and it sent a natural
shudder through the whole three.</p>

<p>“I tell yer,” said old Stebbins, in a solemn undertone, “it
wouldn’t take much to turn me back ag’in toward the
States.”</p>

<p>Black Tom was silent a moment, and then shook his
head.</p>

<p>“No; thar’s gold around us, and we’ll stay long ’nough to
git some of it to pay fur comin’ hyar.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have the Blackfeet swarmin’ all around, than
that ar’ single critter.”</p>

<p>“So would I; but how you goin’ to help it?”</p>

<p>“Kaap with me,” said Teddy. “The baste and mesilf ar’
on the bist of terms, as me Bridget remarked whin she threw
her parlor-sofa (that she used as a bootjack) at me hid, and by
r’ason of me prisence wid yees, ye’ll be thrated in the same
ilegant shtyle.”</p>

<p>All this might be true, but there was little probability of
it, and the two trappers were too great veterans in the service to
place any reliance upon it. Indeed they believed it would be
fatal foolhardiness for the Irishman to trust himself in its
power again.</p>

<p>But they saw no remedy except to retreat, and they were not
yet prepared for that. So they returned to the brook and
resumed their hunt for the gold.</p>

<p>By this time the afternoon was well nigh passed, and little
time was left for them to continue their work. They had
nigh reached the place where they had discovered the auriferous
particles the preceding spring, and they pressed on until
they saw the yellow ore gleaming under the crystal
waters, just as it had gleamed there for many a long year.</p>

<p>“Here’s some of the stuff any way,” said Black Tom, after
he had lifted a lot in his hand and carefully scrutinized it.</p>

<p>“Yes; thar’s no mistake ’bout <em>that</em>,” replied old Stebbins.
“We kin begin work right here, and make more in a day,
than in a week by trapping. So, what do yer say? Do we
resoom?”</p>

<p>“In the mornin’; we’ll take a sleep on it.”</p>

<p>Gathering up their implements, they started on their return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
By the time they were fairly in the cañon again it
was fully dark, and, walled in as they were on either hand by
such high, rocky cliffs, the darkness became so profound that
they could scarcely see a step before them.</p>

<p>But they remembered the route too well to go astray, and
they moved cautiously but unhesitatingly forward in the direction
of the cavern that they had selected for their home,
while at work in this region.</p>

<p>At the upper end of the cañon, indeed before it narrowed
enough really to deserve the name, there was a mass of trees
and undergrowth, through which the three hunters were
making their way, when Black Tom uttered his low, sudden
“’sh!” of alarm.</p>

<p>The others paused and listened, and looked around to learn
the cause of this signal of their companion.</p>

<p>Like the faint twinkle of a star low down in the horizon,
the three caught the glimmer of a camp-fire in this mass of
vegetation and undergrowth.</p>

<p>“I knowed thar war others ’bout,” said Black Tom, after a
moment’s pause; “whether they’re red or white-skins, we can’t
tell till we find out.”</p>

<p>“Let’s do it,” said old Stebbins, and simultaneously the
three set out toward the point of light, moving in the stealthy,
silent manner that had become almost a second nature to them;
but they had not gone far when Tom paused and said:</p>

<p>“Go ahead and l’arn what yer can, and I’ll go down to the
cavern and wait for ye. Thar’s no need of all of us goin’
there.”</p>

<p>The trapper moved away from them as he spoke, not waiting
to hear their opinions; and, as each party met with a curious
adventure very shortly after, we will proceed to give them
in detail.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">BLACK TOM’S ADVENTURE.</span></h2>


<p>Old Stebbins and Teddy O’Doherty crawled carefully over
the rocks and bowlders until they were near enough to gain
an unobstructed view of the camp-fire, when they paused,
somewhat astonished.</p>

<p>Instead of seeing Blackfeet Indians or miners, as they expected,
they descried a single man reclining before the fire,
gazing dreamily into the embers, as though lost in reverie.
He held a long, beautiful rifle in easy grasp, but there were no
signs of any meal in preparation, or of any thing that was
likely to engage his attention.</p>

<p>He was dressed in a sort of sportsman’s costume, with his
pants thrust into high, well-fitting boots, and he was unquestionably
handsome, with fine, regular features, although the
lower part of his face was concealed by a luxuriant auburn
beard.</p>

<p>“The same gintleman that addrissed me so politely last
night,” exclaimed Teddy, in a whisper, although it will be
seen that, when this interview took place, the Irishman was
denied view of the features of the stranger, so that this assertion
was more of a guess than any thing else.</p>

<p>The question now was, whether they should go forward and
make the acquaintance of this stranger, or quietly withdraw
and leave him to his musings. As they were engaged in the
hunt for gold, it was not very desirable to have any more
partners than they already had, and so, after a short and earnest
conference, the hunters stealthily made their way back to
the cañon, and continued their way down it until they reached
“head-quarters.”</p>

<p>Every thing here was found as they had left it, but there
were no signs of Black Tom.</p>

<p>“Where can he be?” was the question they asked of each
other, and, as hour after hour passed away, they could do nothing
but conjecture the cause of his absence. As they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
heard no shout or discharge of gun, they hoped that nothing
serious had befallen him.</p>

<p>At a late hour the two lay down and slept until morning,
and when they rose with the break of day, their friend was
still missing; but, to their inexpressible relief, he came upon
the stage of action in the course of an hour.</p>

<p>“B’ars and bufflers!” he exclaimed, in answer to their questions;
“but this is a little the quarest place I ever got in.
What do you s’pose I’ve been doin’?”</p>

<p>“Makin’ a fool of yourself,” replied old Stebbins.</p>

<p>“No need of that, when I’ve got a couple handy, always,”
retorted Black Tom; “but what do you think it was?”</p>

<p>“Dancing the Donnybrook jig,” replied Teddy. “Ye
might’ve got some old she-bear, or the baste fur yer partner;
yees would be a fine couple, and well matched.”</p>

<p>“<em>No, sir; I’ve been chasin’ a gal!</em>”</p>

<p>“Did ye catch her?”</p>

<p>“No, ’cause I daresn’t.”</p>

<p>The trapper was in earnest, and here is the experience he
gave:</p>

<p>After separating from his friends, on the preceding evening,
he had quietly pursued his way down the cañon, and had
nearly reached his home, when he heard the tramp of a horse,
near at hand. The darkness was so great that he could see
nothing, but he knew the horse was coming directly toward
him; so he stepped to one side and allowed it to pass.</p>

<p>The horse snuffed, and showed some uneasiness, proving that
he was aware of the personality of some one, but he continued
steadily onward, and passed by.</p>

<p>“I’ll foller and l’arn somethin’ ’bout yer,” concluded the
trapper, as he moved silently behind the animal, that could be
easily followed by the sound of its hoofs.</p>

<p>A short distance on the animal turned off into what might
be termed a branch cañon, leading off at a sharp angle from
the one that held Stebbins and Teddy at that moment. Indeed,
the hunters had observed through the day that there
were several entrances into the chasm in which they had
chosen to make their quarters for the time.</p>

<p>In the course of half an hour the gradual rising of the
ground brought them upon the prairie. As the horse stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
upon the high and temporarily level ground, it was brought in
full relief against the sky, the trapper standing somewhat below
it, so that it and its rider were outlined against the faintly-lit
sky, as if drawn in ink.</p>

<p>What was Black Tom’s amazement, when he saw at this
moment that the rider was a woman, with an Indian shawl
thrown around her shoulders! As if she suspected that some
one was near her, she partly turned her head, at the instant
her animal stepped upon the prairie, so that the profile of her
face was plainly seen.</p>

<p>“Skulp me! ef she ain’t a white woman!” fairly gasped
the trapper, who could scarcely credit his senses. “What is
<em>she</em> doin’ hyar?”</p>

<p>There was something in this scene that prevented Black
Tom from calling to her, as he would have done had the circumstances
been different. He recalled that he was in the region
where the supernatural beast had been seen, and a cold
shudder went through him as he reflected that perhaps he was
following a <em>spirit</em> instead of a mortal.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, but he had his share of curiosity,
and it struck him that he might not again have so good an opportunity
of learning something that very probably concerned
the welfare of himself and his companions.</p>

<p>So the next instant he had resumed his pursuit, moving
with the silence of a phantom close behind the horse, that
never halted, but walked with a proud step, as if conscious he
carried a royal burden.</p>

<p>Black Tom had no difficulty in keeping up with the two,
but he was uncertain whether the lady knew she was followed
or not. When on the open ground, there was sufficient light
to gain quite a distinct view of her, although it was by no
means a satisfactory one.</p>

<p>The country was very much broken. As we have stated, it
was cut up by hills, ravines, cañons, streams and open prairie&mdash;but
there were paths leading through these in different directions,
mostly made by animals, so that no one ever need encounter
any difficulty in making his way from one point to another.</p>

<p>The horse with the unknown lady continued forward, with
that unhesitating gait which showed how certain he was of
his way, and that his rider had no fear of his going astray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Skulp me! but this is a qu’ar business I’ve gone in!” muttered
the trapper, as he skulked along behind the animal; “but
I’ll foller till I find out something.”</p>

<p>The way became more broken, but the noble brute kept up
his steady, unswerving gait the same as on the open prairie.
As near as Black Tom could judge they had gone about five
miles, and were ranging along the mountain-side, when he
caught the glow of a light directly in front of the girl, and toward
which she was manifestly traveling.</p>

<p>“Now I shall soon know something,” he muttered, as he saw
the beacon, and allowed the distance between them somewhat
to increase.</p>

<p>It was not long before he made the discovery that there was
an Indian village ahead. He was not a little surprised at this,
as he had never known of a tribe having their settlement in
this place. Still his surprise vanished in a great degree when
he recalled the well-known nomadic habits of all red-skins and
remembered that he had never been in this precise place before,
although he had frequently passed so near it.</p>

<p>He made as thorough a reconnoissance as possible, and learned
that the village was a very small one, numbering scarcely over
twenty lodges. The darkness, however, did not conceal the
fact that they were much better and more substantially built
than was common among the Indians, from which it followed
that if these were Blackfeet, they were a select branch which
did not mingle with the principal tribe.</p>

<p>When this little village was reached, the unknown lady vanished
from view. She seemed to ride directly among the
lodges, where some one probably took charge of her animal,
and she went to her own home.</p>

<p>Black Tom tarried some time, but learned little more. He
saw lights glimmering dimly through the skins of which the
lodges were composed, and he could hear the subdued rumble
of voices within. At first he intended to steal his way among
the lodges; but, as there was nothing particular to be gained
by so doing, he refrained.</p>

<p>The greater part of the night was consumed, and Tom hastened
forward, feeling that he had need of sleep, as he had
been deprived of it altogether the night before. He kept to
the track in returning, and entered the mouth of the cañon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
where his friends were, when he detected the twinkle of the
same camp-fire that had aroused their notice, and which he had
failed to see when so intently following the lady on her horse.</p>

<p>“I may as well make a night of it,” muttered Tom, as he
halted a moment and looked in that direction, “and whoever
owns <em>that ’ere</em> ’stablishment has squatted so near ours that we
orter shake hands.”</p>

<p>Stealing forward in the same stealthy manner, he came in sight
of the young man whom we have already described, and who,
although several hours had elapsed, still sat gazing into the
embers with the same absent, dreamy expression that old Stebbins
and Teddy observed. He had doubtless replenished his
fire since then, as it was burning quite vigorously, but he had
returned to the deep reverie that first distinguished him.</p>

<p>“Wal, now, that’s what I call quite careless,” muttered the
trapper; “thar seems to be plenty of white folks in these parts;
wonder if we are in a civilized country arter all.”</p>

<p>Black Tom looked at the young man a moment and then
concluded to go forward and make his acquaintance.</p>

<p>“He don’t look like a fool if he does act like one,” thought
he, “he looks to me like a chap that’s got a <em>love fit</em> strong.
I’ve been through that mill myself, and know something about
it. Wouldn’t it be qua’r, now, if he should be in love with the
gal I see’d on horseback.”</p>

<p>Perhaps not so strange after all, when every thing should
become known.</p>

<p>“I’ll see what kind of a watch he’s keeping.”</p>

<p>With which Black Tom reached out, and taking hold of a
twig, snapped it so quickly that it made quite a sharp noise.</p>

<p>Quick as lightning, the stranger sprung to his feet, and darted
back in the darkness.</p>

<p>“That’s done pretty well,” concluded the trapper, not a
little pleased at the movement.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” demanded the young man, in a rich bass
voice.</p>

<p>“A friend,” was the instant reply.</p>

<p>“Come forward, then, and show yourself.”</p>

<p>“Hyar I am!” replied Tom, as he stepped forward in the
light of the camp-fire, and waited for the stranger to show
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I am glad to see you. My name is Hammond&mdash;Fred
Hammond, and I am pleased to meet you.”</p>

<p>These words of welcome were uttered as the tall, graceful
form of the speaker moved forward, and he reached out his
hand and grasped the hard palm of the hunter.</p>

<p>Black Tom looked significantly around him.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Hammond, with a smile.</p>

<p>“S’pose it had been a red-skin instead of Black Tom that
crept up to you in that style, the crack of the twig would have
been the crack of a rifle, and that would have been the last of
Fred Hammond.”</p>

<p>“It looked foolhardy, I’ll admit,” said he, with a laugh,
“but then it wasn’t, after all. There is no danger of either
you or me being disturbed by Indians to-night.”</p>

<p>“How do you know so much ’bout the red-skins in these
parts?” asked the trapper, in some surprise.</p>

<p>“I’ve been here several months, and during that time I
ought to have learned something, had I not?” he returned,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Wal, I tell yer what <em>I</em> know,” added the trapper, earnestly,
“thar ar’ red-skins in a few miles of hyar.”</p>

<p>Black Tom noticed how his companion started, as he instantly
asked:</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I’ve seen ’em&mdash;since the sun went down, too.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Off yender,” replied Tom, pointing in the direction of
the village, “I see’d a white a gal on a horse and I just follered
and watched her.”</p>

<p>The partial gloom in which the two men sat, nor the luxuriant
whiskers, could not conceal the flush that overspread
Hammond’s face at the utterance of these words.</p>

<p>“Where did you see her?” he asked, making a great effort
to hide his deep interest.</p>

<p>“Why she rid up out the <em>kenyon</em>, and I follered arter her.”</p>

<p>“Did you speak to her?”</p>

<p>“No, she didn’t seem to notice me, so I didn’t offer to
shake hands.”</p>

<p>“Strange!” exclaimed Hammond, as if musing with himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and then he was about sinking into a reverie, when
Black Tom aroused him.</p>

<p>“See yer, Hammond, as I b’leve you call yourself, thar
seems to be something in this gal that in’trests <em>you</em>. Ain’t
that so now?”</p>

<p>“Well, I see no objection to confessing that there is.”</p>

<p>“Who is she?”</p>

<p>“I can not say. You are right in supposing that she is
a white girl. She is of our own race and blood, and is a
prisoner, although a not very unwilling one, among a small
tribe of Indians near at hand.”</p>

<p>Black Tom was somewhat pleased with Hammond; he had
that admiration for a learned man which the ignorant invariably
feel, and he saw from the manner of his speaking that
he was a “scholar.” Besides that he possessed a blandness of
manner that predisposed all in his favor&mdash;but, at the same
time, he was not prepared as yet to invite him to make one
of their party.</p>

<p>There was a mystery, which the trapper was desirous to
penetrate, and with characteristic bluntness he put his questions
point-blank.</p>

<p>“What brings yer in this part of the country?”</p>

<p>Hammond looked at him rather quizzically; the movement
of his whiskers showed that he was smiling.</p>

<p>“It is <em>not</em> the object that brings <em>you</em> and your companions
here.”</p>

<p>“What do you know ’bout that?”</p>

<p>“All.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“<em>Gold.</em>”</p>

<p>“Wal, you’re right&mdash;no use denyin’ that&mdash;but, how do
you know it, Hammond? That’s what I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear fellow, I know that you and two comrades
have taken up your head-quarters down the cañon; I
know also that there is gold here. All that remains for me
to do, is to put this and that together.”</p>

<p>“Wal, you ain’t nobody’s fool,” returned the trapper, after
a moment’s pause, “but I don’t know, arter all, but what a
fool could have told that. Ain’t you huntin’ arter gold?&mdash;now,
honest&mdash;no foolin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir,” was the response.</p>

<p>“Why ain’t yer?”</p>

<p>Hammond laughed quite heartily before he answered:</p>

<p>“Your questions are rather pointed, Tom, and such as I
deem too pointed you will permit me to decline answering.”</p>

<p>“Sartinly; you needn’t answer any, if they don’t suit you.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that, Tom; therefore, I am not hunting for
gold for the simple reason that I don’t need it. There is considerable
of the precious metal about here, but it can only be
obtained by hard labor, and when I am at home I am in
comfortable circumstances. Is that satisfactory, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Yas. Wal, I’m poor, and so are all the chaps that be
with me, and we think we see a chance to better ourselves.”</p>

<p>“So you do; go ahead and you will do well enough.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been here several months?”</p>

<p>“Yes; during most of the season.”</p>

<p>“And hain’t huntin’ arter gold?”</p>

<p>“Not at all.”</p>

<p>“See yer,” suddenly exclaimed Black Tom, “have you seen
any thing of that striped and speckled critter that chaws up
red-skins whole?”</p>

<p>“I know the animal to which you refer,” replied Hammond,
more seriously. “I have seen it more than once.”</p>

<p>“Did it ever hurt yer?”</p>

<p>“I don’t look dangerously hurt, do I?” laughed Hammond,
as he surveyed his own person, as if searching for grievous
wounds. “No; it has never harmed me, but it <em>has</em> killed
many a one.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know nothin’ ’bout it?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I told you enough?”</p>

<p>This was evasive, but it answered the purpose for which it
was uttered. Hammond knew a great deal about this anomalous
creature. Indeed, had he chosen, he could have told the
secret regarding it&mdash;a most wonderful secret, which the reader
shall learn in due time.</p>

<p>But his lips were sealed. He had not the right to tell
what he knew&mdash;not yet. The time might come when he
could tell all, but, for the present, he must remain mute.</p>

<p>“It beats any thin’ I ever heard tell on,” said the trapper,
as if talking to himself. “I b’lieve it’s a spook.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“See here,” said Hammond, looking up in his frank, pleasing
manner, “you seem to be a good, honest soul, and I
will tell you something, confidentially. You are wondering
why I am in this out-of-the-way part of the world, and I reply
that I am seeking not gold, but what is far above gold and
pearls&mdash;and that is the lady you saw on horseback to-night!”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">GOLD!</span></h2>


<p>“I b’lieve I’ll dig out of these parts,” said Black Tom,
with a sigh, after he had heard the explanation of Fred Hammond.</p>

<p>“Why so?” quietly asked the latter.</p>

<p>“Things don’t look right to me; I don’t understand ’bout
that speckled critter, nor ’bout the critter I’ve seen on the
kenyon on horseback. I b’lieve <em>she’s</em> a sperit.”</p>

<p>“No; she’s as much flesh and blood as you are. I have
spoken to her.”</p>

<p>“Have you axed her to dig out of these parts?”</p>

<p>“I have, more than once.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t she do it?”</p>

<p>“We’ll let the answer to that question remain in abeyance
for the present,” was the graceful response of Hammond. “I
think she will do so, but the time has not yet come for such
an important step to be taken.”</p>

<p>“Let me ax you something else, then. Do them Blackfeet
where she’s stayin’ <em>b’long thar</em>?”</p>

<p>“They have lived there a long time, and no doubt expect
to remain there for a long time to come, but they do not belong
to the Blackfeet tribe.”</p>

<p>“What tribe, then?”</p>

<p>“They are the Meagans.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard tell of them, years ago, but I thought they war
all dead.”</p>

<p>“They were once a powerful tribe, and these are all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
are left of them, scarcely a hundred souls. You know they
are <em>Christians</em>.”</p>

<p>Black Tom did not know that, nor did he know any thing
of them, except that such a tribe had once been a power in
the West, but he had supposed hitherto that they had vanished
from the earth long since.</p>

<p>“They have been Christianized through the efforts of the
good Moravian missionaries,” continued Hammond, “and they
live a quiet, unobtrusive life among themselves, disturbing nobody,
and desirous of being left alone by all who pass through
this region.”</p>

<p>“What is the gal doing with them?”</p>

<p>“Suppose we drop all reference to her for the present,”
was the pleasant reply of his companion; “you are here for
the purpose of hunting gold, and I must warn you not to interfere
with the Meagans.”</p>

<p>“We won’t hurt them if they let us alone,” was the sturdy
reply of the trapper, “but they must keep thar hands off.”</p>

<p>“They won’t be likely to disturb you, although they do not
like the presence of any one in these parts.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Because they are aware of the existence of gold, and
they know if that fact becomes generally known, they will
have to pack up and leave.”</p>

<p>“Be thar any other white men besides us hyar?”</p>

<p>“Quite a number have passed through, but I don’t think
there are any besides your company.”</p>

<p>“The Blackfeet are here sometimes?”</p>

<p>“Yes; their hunting and war parties occasionally pass
through, but they know of the Meagans, respect their character,
and never offer to molest them.”</p>

<p>“I see; but how ’bout us?” asked Black Tom, with a grin.</p>

<p>“It ain’t likely they would be so careful about treading on
your corns. Heigho!”</p>

<p>This exclamation on the part of Hammond was caused by
the growing light around them showing that day was
breaking. The trapper was startled somewhat, but he was
deeply interested in his new acquaintance, and continued
chatting some time longer. As he was ready to move away,
Tom said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“See hyar, Hammond, our mansion is down near t’other
end the kenyon, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know very well where it is,” interrupted the young man,
bowing slightly and smiling.</p>

<p>“Wal, what I war goin’ to hit at war this: come thar and
make your head-quarters with us. We’re huntin’ gold and
you are huntin’ the gal; but we’ve got to do a little sleepin’
now and then, and why can’t you bunk with us?”</p>

<p>“I thank you, Tom; I may accept your invitation, but not
just at present. However, we will keep up the acquaintance
so pleasantly commenced, and I will call on you now and
then.”</p>

<p>This was their parting, and making their way out of the
bushes, Black Tom continued on down the cañon, reaching his
friends, when both were quite anxious regarding him.</p>

<p>After telling his story, there was a consultation. All were
quite hungry, and it was agreed that old Stebbins should start
off on a quest for food, and Teddy should keep guard during
his absence, which time Black Tom proposed to devote to
sleep.</p>

<p>This arrangement was carried out to the letter. Tom secured
two good hours’ rest, which were all that he needed,
Teddy acted faithfully his part as sentinel, and old Stebbins
came back with the hind-quarters of a young antelope slung
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Some was broiled over the fire, and the three hunters devoured
it with an appetite that was absolutely wolfish, scarcely
speaking until it was finished, when Tom asked, somewhat
bluntly:</p>

<p>“Did you see nothin’ of the speckled and ring-tailed critter?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’, but I see’d sign.”</p>

<p>“Blazes! whar?”</p>

<p>“Off yonder.”</p>

<p>As he replied he pointed off to the left, which was in a
totally different direction from the one leading toward the
Meagan village, proof that they were hostile Indians.</p>

<p>“Thar’s ’bout a dozen,” added old Stebbins. “They’re
Blackfeet in thar war-paint, and they’re goin’ fur somebody.”</p>

<p>“Bad ’cess to ’em!” exclaimed Teddy, who had managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
light his pipe. “Give us the chance and we’ll show ’em a
thing or two.”</p>

<p>The matter was discussed pro and con, when it was agreed
that the three should separate and take different directions.
Each of the three were to search for gold and Indians. By
this means there was a better prospect of finding the precious
metal than if they went in company, and if danger from the
Blackfeet threatened, there was scarcely a possibility that it
would escape the vigilance of all three.</p>

<p>Old Stebbins took somewhat the same route that he followed
in his morning hunt, his principal purpose being to look
out for Blackfeet. Teddy went up the brook, his object being
gold, while Black Tom, after getting clear of the cañon,
diverged to the right, his purpose being both.</p>

<p>Leaving the two former to themselves for the present, it
becomes necessary once more to follow the adventures of
Black Tom.</p>

<p>His course led him across a short space of open prairie,
when he entered a wild section, better fitted for the habitations
of the chamois or mountain goat, than for any other
animal.</p>

<p>He was constantly passing around deep chasms, climbing
rocks, clambering through bushes, sometimes leaving the debris
and loose stones rattling behind him, with a noise that was
startling, until he found himself in a small, narrow valley,
through which ran a stream somewhat larger than the one in
the cañon that he had left a short time before.</p>

<p>The trapper carefully surveyed the bluffs and elevated points
surrounding him, but all was as quiet as at “creation’s morn.”
Not even the cry of a bird, or the whirr of its wing broke
the impressive stillness of the solitude.</p>

<p>Tom was somewhat affected by the grand solemnity of the
scene around him, and he stood a moment leaning upon his
rifle, silent and thoughtful, swayed by those reverential emotions
which, at times, come over the most ignorant of mankind.</p>

<p>While standing thus with his eyes fixed upon the ascending
side of the valley, he was startled by seeing the loose dirt
and stones, directly beneath a clump of bushes, rattle down
the declivity, as though they had been dislodged by the foot
of some person or animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The trapper was on the alert instantly. His eagle eye was
fixed upon the bushes, with the sharp, penetrating glance of
suspicion; but the vegetation was too dense and luxuriant for
him to discover whether there was any thing beneath them
or not.</p>

<p>“Wonder ef that was a Blackfoot,” he muttered, as he held
his rifle ready for use at a second’s warning. “Some confounded
varmint like as not is follerin’ me. I’ll see ef I
can.”</p>

<p>Raising his gun to his shoulder, he aimed directly at the
center of the bushes and discharged it. No response followed,
not even the rattling of an additional pebble. All remained
as quiet and motionless as before the disturbance took place.</p>

<p>This almost convinced the trapper that there was no man
or animal concealed there. Even had he not hit him with
his bullet, the shot itself would have caused a movement that
would have loosened the debris again.</p>

<p>“I guess the thing done itself,” he concluded, as he reloaded
his piece, and scrutinized a moment or two longer.</p>

<p>As he moved away, he occasionally turned his head and
glanced back, but saw nothing to renew his suspicions, and
by the time he had passed a hundred yards down the valley,
he had come to the opinion that there was but one eye that
was surveying his movements&mdash;and that was the eye that
looked upon him in kindness and mercy, as it does upon all
mortals.</p>

<p>Still no signs of gold.</p>

<p>He was now following the course of the stream down the
valley. In some places it brawled over stones, with a noise
that shut out all other sounds, and then it flowed calmly and
still, like the current of a deep river.</p>

<p>It was of crystal clearness, and there was no place where
he could not distinguish the bottom, as easily as though it were
“liquid air” floating at his feet.</p>

<p>“Wonder ef thar’s any use of my wadin’ in thar, turnin’
over them stones, and lookin’ under them&mdash;”</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused. What did he see?</p>

<p>He looked steadily a moment, and his heart gave a jump,
as he plainly distinguished something yellow glistening in the
center of the bed. The next instant he had plunged into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
stream, which was about a foot in depth, and thrusting his arm
down, brought it to the surface and held it up to view.</p>

<p>Yes; it was a solid lump of pure gold!</p>

<p>Black Tom was certain of it. It was about the size of a
hen’s egg, very heavy, and bright and glistening. There could
be no doubt of its nature.</p>

<p>He waded ashore again, and then “hefted” it, turned it
over and over, tossed it in the air, caught it, smelled of it, put
his tongue to it and was delighted.</p>

<p>Why should he not be delighted? Was not this what had
brought him to this region? Was it not worth more than
many days’ labor of trapping?</p>

<p>“That’s the fust crop!” he exclaimed, as he carefully put it
away about his person; “and it follers that thar must be more
of the same sort ’bout hyar.”</p>

<p>The day was quite cool, and he was pretty wet; but he felt
it not. His feelings were excited, and he was tenfold more
anxious for the precious metal than he had ever been before.
It seemed as if there was an all-controlling appetite that had
hitherto been latent, that was now aroused to action, and that
overcame every other emotion.</p>

<p>He thought nothing now of personal danger. Gold, gold,
was his thirst, and it led him on his eager search.</p>

<p>The trapper walked along the edge of the stream, totally
oblivious to every thing but the one thing that just then occupied
his thoughts, to the exclusion of every thing else.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed thus, when he was aroused from this
condition by a sharp voice, calling almost in his very ears:</p>

<p>“Hello there!” Starting back, Tom looked up and saw
Fred Hammond standing a few feet in front of him.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the hunter.</p>

<p>“You must get out of here, without a moment’s delay.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” exclaimed Tom, staring about him
as though he had just awakened to a sense of his perilous
condition.</p>

<p>“The Blackfeet are after you.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Everywhere,” replied Hammond, somewhat excitedly;
“there are two or three coming up the stream, and several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
coming down. They are trying to surround you, and if you
remain here five minutes longer, you are a dead man.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t killed quite so easy as that,” said Tom, somewhat
sullenly. “Ef thar ar’ any red-skins that ar’ goin’ to make a
dead man of me, jest fetch ’em along; that’s what’s the matter.”</p>

<p>“Follow me, and don’t wait an instant,” commanded Hammond,
fairly seizing upon him.</p>

<p>Instead of running either up or down-stream, the young
man led the way to the high, steep side of the valley, which
was thickly wooded, and extended full five hundred feet upward
from where they stood.</p>

<p>Up this the two hounded like goats, half crawling and
climbing through the wood and undergrowth, until, panting
and almost exhausted, they reached the high ground above,
where they paused awhile to gain their breath before proceeding
further in this dangerous territory.</p>

<p>They had penetrated such a distance that they were effectually
concealed from the view of whatever Indians there might
be in the valley below, although, of course, the red-skins could
easily follow their trail.</p>

<p>They stood a moment in silence, and then, when they had
recovered their breath, Hammond placed his hand familiarly
upon the shoulder of the trapper, and said, earnestly and
kindly:</p>

<p>“Tom, you are an old hunter, and know more of the red-men
and their ways than I do, but that doesn’t signify that
you are in no need of counsel. I was wandering through this
section, when I discovered your danger. It was not the situation
of your body, so much as it was the condition of your
mind. You had found gold, and were so excited over it, that
a Blackfoot might have slipped up behind and tomahawked
you. I saw it, and I got you up here, that you might recover
your senses. There is gold down there&mdash;plenty of it; hunt
carefully and you will find, but don’t look down all the while&mdash;<span class="smcap">LOOK
UP!</span>”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE LOVERS.</span></h2>


<p>Hammond felt that he had done his duty. He had awakened
the trapper to a sense of his personal danger, and that was
enough. Without waiting for his reply, he moved rapidly
away, taking a direction that led toward the Meagan village.</p>

<p>When he had gone a few hundred yards, a close scrutiny
would have revealed that he was following a path&mdash;a very
slight one, it is true, but still sufficiently defined to show that
it was familiar to him.</p>

<p>On he walked, until he had traversed fully a mile, when he
paused and began carefully to examine the bushes that overhung
the path. Suddenly, he found a leaf that was twisted in
a peculiar manner, and instantly his face brightened.</p>

<p>“She is coming! she is coming!” he exclaimed, to himself,
after he had carefully examined it a moment.</p>

<p>The words were yet in his mouth, when a light footstep
was heard, and the next instant a rare vision burst upon him.</p>

<p>She did not appear to be over twenty years of age at the
most, and she was as beautiful as an Oriental dream. Her
cheeks had the tint of the pearl, her hair was abundant, of
glossy blackness, confined by a red band at the neck; her features
were faultlessly regular, her eyes dark and lustrous, her
form rounded and perfect, while the half-Indian dress, with its
brilliant and varied colors, set her figure off to the best advantage.</p>

<p>Over all there was that indescribable charm of perfect
physical health&mdash;that charm which makes the homely handsome,
without which the most perfect features lack fascination,
and which, when added to the handsome woman, places her
upon the very pinnacle of female loveliness.</p>

<p>She came forward somewhat timidly, while Hammond, his
face aglow with happiness, hurried forward to meet her.
Seizing one of her hands in both of his, he pressed it warmly,
and exclaimed, in the low, sweet voice of fervent love:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lamora, you have granted my prayer; you have come
again; you have allowed me to see you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, in a low, sweet voice, “you know that
Lamora is your friend.”</p>

<p>“I hope she is more than that.”</p>

<p>“No, no.”</p>

<p>Her eyes were upon the ground and she shook her head
with an indescribable sadness in her manner.</p>

<p>She was a white woman; she spoke the English language
fluently, and she seemed to understand her own race. She
was modest and reserved, and although one might reasonably
suspect that she felt no little interest in Hammond, yet
it was no blind, reckless passion, such as an ignorant person
sometimes shows, but a pure, maidenly emotion.</p>

<p>“Lamora,” said the lover, still holding her hand and looking
tenderly down in her face, “you are a white person of
the same blood as myself; you live among the Indians; do
you not wish to return to your own kindred?”</p>

<p>“Why should I?” she returned, in the same sorrowful
voice. “I do not know that I have any relations living; I
have almost forgotten their names. I have no one but a
father, and he has long since forgotten that he had a child
stolen by the Indians.”</p>

<p>“How old were you when you were taken away?”</p>

<p>“I could not have been more than five years.”</p>

<p>“How is it that you speak English so well?”</p>

<p>Lamora looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>“My tribe use the language, more than their own tongue.”</p>

<p>“Was it the Meagans that stole you?”</p>

<p>“No; <em>they</em> would not do such a thing. I was stolen by the
Sioux, shortly after my father had emigrated to the West.
They killed my mother and sisters and brothers, but father
escaped, and I was carried away captive.”</p>

<p>“How did you learn all this.”</p>

<p>“Kipwan, who is the chief of our tribe, and who is my
adopted father, ransomed me of the Sioux who claimed me as
his booty, and from him he got the particulars of my misfortune.”</p>

<p>Hammond was silent a moment, as if in doubt to ask the
question trembling upon his tongue, but he uttered it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you yourself no recollection of that terrible time?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember it well. It was a fearful experience
indeed, but it was so long since that I can think upon it,
without the shuddering you would suppose I ought to feel.
I remember the long ride in the emigrant wagon&mdash;the halt in
the woods&mdash;the cutting down of the trees&mdash;the building of
the cabin&mdash;the howling of the wolves at night&mdash;my sports
with my brothers and sisters by the brook that ran near the
house&mdash;the dark night when we were all awakened from
sleep by the whoops of Indians&mdash;the burning of the cabin&mdash;the
tomahawking of my mother as she threw herself between
her children who were huddling together in terror&mdash;the slaying
of them&mdash;the brave but useless fight my father made&mdash;how
I was then caught up in the arms of a savage and borne
away in the dark woods. Oh, it was a dreadful sight!”</p>

<p>And in spite of what Lamora had said, her feelings overcame
her, and she sobbed as if her heart was breaking.</p>

<p>Her lover was silent out of respect and sympathy for her,
until she had regained her self-command in a degree, when
he said in the kindest of tones:</p>

<p>“It was cruel in me to call up the remembrance; will you
forgive me?”</p>

<p>“It is past now,” she replied. “Then follows a summer
in an Indian village on the shore of some great lake, where
I was treated harshly, and then, one day, Kipwan, an old
man, and a Christian Indian, came to the village, and when
he went away he took me with him on his horse. We rode
a long distance until we reached his tribe, where I staid until
I was quite a girl, when they moved a great way westward
to this place, where we have been ever since.”</p>

<p>“And during all this time, did you feel no longing to return
to your father?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I shed many tears, but I was treated with
great kindness, and the longing gradually wore away until it
entirely disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Entirely so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, entirely.”</p>

<p>“And do you think you can be content to spend the remainder
of your life among those Indians, and finally to die
there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not? I have no enemies; they are all my friends.”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt that; but they are savage and you are
civilized; they are of one race and you of another.”</p>

<p>“It is a difference to you but none to me,” she said, sorrowfully.
“Nowhere else could I find such friends as
there.”</p>

<p>“Do you doubt me, dearest Lamora? Do you not believe
that I love you? that I am yours, heart and soul? Tell me,
do you think I am deceiving you?”</p>

<p>Her head drooped still lower, but she replied distinctly:</p>

<p>“No; I do not think you would do that.”</p>

<p>“Then do not doubt me; I will take you to my own
home; you shall be mine and I shall be yours; there is nothing
that love can do for you that shall not be done. Can you
not be happy in my love?”</p>

<p>She was silent a few moments, as if too much affected to
speak. Hammond truly and deeply loved this girl, and had
all the eagerness of a young lover to carry away the prize
with him. He had spent several months here, held solely by
the magnetism of her presence.</p>

<p>We have described in the first chapter his singular meeting
with her, and the deep impression her appearance and her
act of kindness had made upon him. True to his declaration,
he had left his companions, and had devoted all to searching
her out. He knew that she dwelt somewhere in this neighborhood,
but it was a long time before he could discover her.</p>

<p>Seemingly by pure accident he had encountered her a few
days before. As may be supposed, she was greatly surprised
to see him, and their first interview was quite embarrassing
upon both sides.</p>

<p>But their acquaintance rapidly progressed, until we have
shown how he learned much regarding her early history, and
finally declared his love to her.</p>

<p>It was plain, and Hammond saw that he had awakened a
tender interest in her, but she had not yet reached the point
of giving her love unreservedly to him. She was strongly
attached to Kipwan and her Meagan friends, and it was a painful
struggle for her to decide to leave them forever.</p>

<p>“You have grown up among the people who have treated
you kindly, and to whom you feel devotedly attached. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
natural that you should; <em>I</em> love them because of their kindness
to you; but you are fitted for another life than this; go
with me, and you shall never regret the step.”</p>

<p>Hitherto the two had been standing, but now Hammond
conducted her some distance from the path to a flat rock,
where the two seated themselves.</p>

<p>It was a bright sunshiny day; they were enveloped in shrubbery
and undergrowth, which were so dense about them, that
they were invisible to any one a short distance away.</p>

<p>They sat in silence for a few moments; their hearts too
full for speech. <em>She</em> was thinking how much she loved the
noble figure beside her: how happy she could be to yield her
heart to him, and to go where she could be wholly his.
But&mdash;</p>

<p>“Can I? Is it best? Heaven direct me!”</p>

<p>She prayed earnestly for guidance, for, like the simple-minded
people among whom she dwelt, she was a devout
believer in the protecting care of heaven.</p>

<p>It was hard for her to decide, and still the struggle went on.</p>

<p>Hammond was partly sitting and reclining, and now and
then gazing up in the face of the maid beside him. It seemed
to him that with each look the wonderful loveliness of her
face increased.</p>

<p>“She is beautiful&mdash;surpassingly beautiful,” he thought, as
he looked, returning again and again to feast upon the vision.
“No one can help admiring her; no one can deny that she is
faultless in form and feature, and yet it is not <em>that</em> alone which
has drawn me toward her. She is devoutly religious, good,
and with a heart of the tenderest sympathy. I <em>must</em> have
her; I can not live without her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lamora,” said he, sitting upright, and drawing her
to him, “you must go home with me; you must be my wife;
you will find nothing but kindness awaiting you; you will
have the heart of your lover forever. You must; you shall
go.”</p>

<p>The beautiful head, with its wealth of black hair, was now
resting unresistingly upon his shoulder. He gently raised it,
and imprinted a kiss upon the warm cheek.</p>

<p>“Answer me, Lamora,” he said, in the gentlest of voices,
“do you love me, or do you feel indifferent toward me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>I love you; I can not help it!</em>”</p>

<p>“Heaven bless you! who wants you to help it?” exclaimed
the delighted Hammond, as he rained his kisses, and she
smiled through her tears, and showed how perfect her happiness
was, in confessing her love.</p>

<p>“Lamora, <em>will</em> you be mine? Will you go home with
me?”</p>

<p>She looked at him unflinchingly in the face, and a seraphic
light seemed to suffuse her eyes and countenance as she answered:</p>

<p>“Yes, I will go to your home with you and be yours.”</p>

<p>“Ah! who on earth does not envy me!” exclaimed the
overjoyed lover. “You are mine; your promise is given.
You feel no regrets?”</p>

<p>“No; none at all,” she answered, with the same bewitching
sweetness.</p>

<p>“I thank Providence for this,” said Hammond, fervently.
“You have intrusted your happiness into my hands, and
never, no, <em>never</em> shall you regret it.”</p>

<p>Ah! they were happy moments to both. It was “love’s
young dream,” in all its measureless hight and depth; their
cup was pressed down and running over.</p>

<p>They talked and chatted, and billed and cooed, and replighted
and revowed, as only young lovers can in the fulness
of their hearts, and when an hour or two had slipped by in
this delightful manner, then they began to discuss the matter
practically.</p>

<p>“Will you leave your friends, without acquainting them of
your determination?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No; that would be cruel; they would never cease hunting
and searching for me, and it would break Kipwan’s
heart.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell him all?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he will object or attempt to dissuade
you?”</p>

<p>“He is too good a man to attempt either. He will feel
sorrowful, and so shall I, at the separation from those who
have been such friends to me all my life&mdash;but he will wish
me good-speed upon my journey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“He must be a good man indeed, and I should like to go
into the village and take him by the hand,” said Hammond,
who felt just then that he could take any one in the world by
the hand.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied; “do not show yourself in the village.
You know why?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, looking inquiringly at her.</p>

<p>“In the first place, they are always uneasy at the approach
of strangers, and then, when it became known that you are
the cause of my leaving them, some of the younger members
might not feel so particularly Christian toward you.”</p>

<p>“I see; it shall be as you say. I will wait your own good
time and pleasure, praying you to remember that the days will
drag wearily until we turn our faces eastward.”</p>

<p>“I shall not be long.”</p>

<p>“Two or three days, I suppose, will be all-sufficient?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, but I can not say with certainty.”</p>

<p>“And there is no danger of your desiring to withdraw
your consent; you can never be sorry for your promise.”</p>

<p>“Not so long as you do not forget yours.”</p>

<p>“Then it can never be,” was the ardent reply of Hammond,
as he again pressed her to him, and imprinted a kiss
upon her cheek.</p>

<p>She gently freed herself, and rising to her feet, stood
calmly before him, looking lovingly and trustingly in his
face.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, after a moment’s pause, “I do not think one
of us ever will be sorry for this. You profess to love me,
and I believe you, and I know, too, that you have the whole,
undivided affection of Cecilia Alamant&mdash;that she is yours, now
and forever!”</p>

<p>But there must be an end to all things, and the lovers became
sensible that several hours had passed since they met,
and it was now past noon. Lamora moved toward the path,
Hammond still holding her hand and walking beside her.</p>

<p>“I do not know which is the prettiest, your Indian or your
Christian name,” he remarked, as they walked slowly along.</p>

<p>“I am the most accustomed to the first, but I suppose
I shall lose that when I leave them.”</p>

<p>“It was that by which I first knew you, and I never wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to forget it. There will be a charm clinging to it which can
never lose its fascination for me.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can call me by both,” she laughed; “one will
suit me as well as the other.”</p>

<p>“Lamora,” suddenly spoke up Hammond, “there are three
white men near us; they are searching for gold. If they
are successful we may all return to the States together.”</p>

<p>“That will be safer, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“They have been greatly alarmed by this strange&mdash;what
shall I call it?&mdash;creature that makes his home near your village.”</p>

<p>“It has not harmed them?” she asked, with a peculiar expression.</p>

<p>“No; but they are much terrified. Why not tell <em>them</em> the
secret?”</p>

<p>“You know Kipwan’s wish,” she answered, earnestly. “I
could not do so without his permission.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not; but doubtless you can obtain it. This is
an exceptional instance, and will be to our interest to have them
acquainted with the facts.”</p>

<p>She promised to ask the old chief’s advice, and then moved
along the path more rapidly. A hundred yards or so away
her horse was found quietly cropping the grass and herbage.
Without any assistance from her lover, Lamora vaulted lightly
upon his back, bade Hammond a gay good-by, and the next
moment had vanished in the direction of the Indians’ home.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“I HAD A DREAM WHICH WAS NOT ALL A DREAM.”</span></h2>


<p>There could be no doubt that gold in abundance existed
in the section of the country where the three men had located
themselves. We have shown the discovery made by Black
Tom, and showed, too, how narrowly he escaped falling into
the hands of his enemies.</p>

<p>Teddy O’Doherty and old Stebbins took a different direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and without knowing it reached the same stream in which
their comrade had found his nugget, but at a point considerably
lower down. They were walking along in an indifferent
manner, scarcely expecting to find the precious metal, and
yet searching for it on “general principles.”</p>

<p>“<em>Morra! howly Vargin!</em>”</p>

<p>And with a panther-like leap and screech, the Irishman
made a leap far out in the creek, dashed his hand into the
water, as though he had caught at a salmon, and then he
sprung back again.</p>

<p>“What in thunder is the matter?” demanded the amazed
trapper, as he stood wondering whether his friend had suddenly
turned crazy, or whether he had been struck by some
silent arrow.</p>

<p>“That’s the matther,” replied Teddy, as he held up an irregular
nugget of gold, the size of a hen’s egg. “Isn’t that
’nough to make a fellow dance the jig, as me uncle obsarved
whin he resaved tidings that his beloved wife was no
more?”</p>

<p>And, without further words, Teddy tipped his hat upon
one side of his head, placed his arms akimbo, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a la</i> Barney
Williams, and executed a jig, dancing back and forth and
around old Stebbins, who, having received the yellow nugget
from his hand, smelt and tasted and “hefted” it, until no
doubt could remain that they had secured a most valuable
piece of pure virgin gold.</p>

<p>By-and-by Teddy became exhausted and ceased dancing.</p>

<p>“We’ve sthruck luck, haven’t we?” he asked, as he nudged
the old trapper in the ribs.</p>

<p>“Yas; thar ain’t no gitting over that,” he answered, as
he handed back the heavy chunk; “that’s worth <em>several</em> beaver
hides. Why don’t you take it?”</p>

<p>But Teddy declined receiving it.</p>

<p>“It’s a prisent to you, to ’mind yees of this day’s hunt.”</p>

<p>“Thar’s little danger of my furgettin’ it,” returned the
trapper, as he carefully placed the prize in his pocket; “but
s’pose we don’t find no more.”</p>

<p>“Little fear; but let’s folly the sthraam down&mdash;hark!”</p>

<p>Both listened. As the channel of the stream was quite
smooth at this point, scarcely any noise was made; but, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
stood motionless and listening, they heard a distinct roar, the
meaning of which was clear to all.</p>

<p>“The stream <em>kenyons</em> afore it goes much further,” remarked
old Stebbins, as they resumed their progress.</p>

<p>One was on either side the stream, vigilantly searching
the bed of the limpid stream, as they walked along; but
they saw nothing more of the coveted saffron, and every
step they took brought them near the cañon, which could
now be at no great distance.</p>

<p>Finally they came in sight of the place, where the stream
narrowed and deepened and increased in velocity, while the
banks rose to a hight of twenty and more feet, so close in
some places that a man could easily leap across.</p>

<p>The instant they caught sight of the cañon, Teddy O’Doherty
started back, with an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>“Crazy ag’in!” asked the trapper, somewhat provoked at
his performances.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen that place <em>afore</em>.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Last night.”</p>

<p>Stebbins looked at him, as if he verily believed his head was
turned. Before he could speak, Teddy added, in a voice free
from all jest.</p>

<p>“I saw that place in a dhraam durin’ the little shlaap I
secured last avening. Yis,” he added, “jist exactly as I
saa it there.”</p>

<p>“Wal, what of it?”</p>

<p>“And I dhramed that a little ways down the kinyon
widened out, so that the sthraam run slower like, and down
thar was <em>goold</em>&mdash;yes, goold enough to make a sootible prisent
to the Pope of Rome, and there it had been layin’ fur miny
long years, waitin’ till Teddy O’Doherty should come along
and scoop it up&mdash;and that’s jist what Teddy O’Doherty is
goin’ to do this minute.”</p>

<p>And diverging to the right, they began making their way
up out of the valley, so as to come up around to the cañon
at the top. Before they had reached, or were near enough
to decide the point, the Irishman stopped again, and laying
his hand upon the arm of his companion, said, in the same
deeply earnest manner:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do yees belaave me dhraam, Steb.?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say yet,” returned the trapper, reluctant to confess
his faith in that, which, to say the least, had deeply impressed
him.</p>

<p>“I dhraamed that the widenin’ in the kinyon was about a
hundred yards below where the kinyon begins. Let us saa
whither it is true.”</p>

<p>With an intensity of interest which it would be difficult
to understand, the two men strode rapidly forward, their gait
increasing almost to a run, as they neared the cañon. A few
moments more and the question was settled.</p>

<p>The widening of the cañon was precisely as Teddy had
dreamed!</p>

<p>Both men stood, for several moments too astounded to
speak. Then the Irishman asked, with a strange smile:</p>

<p>“Do yees belave it now?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the awed reply.</p>

<p>“And do yees belave thar is goold down there?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it.”</p>

<p>“Thin all we have to do is to git it.”</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s the difficulty.</p>

<p>“And, be jabers, how is it to be done?” continued Teddy,
with something like his natural joviality of manner. “I
didn’t <em>dhraam that</em>!”</p>

<p>They approached the edge of the cañon, and carefully examined
it. At the point referred to it was nearly twenty feet
in width; and, as this was very nearly the usual latitude of the
stream, it flowed by this place as smoothly and quietly as
the dead level.</p>

<p>Looking over the edge of the chasm, they could discern the
edge of a table or ledge, which seemed to be the floor of some
cavern that extended quite a distance back into the rocks.
This was the point which Teddy was desirous of reaching.</p>

<p>But how was it to be done? The natural plan was to drop
down upon it; but as it projected at the most only a few
inches beyond the perpendicular wall, it was morally certain
that, if he should strike the edge, he could not “stick,” while,
so far as could be ascertained, it was too high above the stream
to be reached by any one standing in the bed of that.</p>

<p>The only possible way, therefore, was to be lowered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
some rope, or something that would answer the same purpose,
and such a thing was not in the possession of a member of
the company.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?”</p>

<p>The two men stood silent, and debating the question with
themselves. Neither had the remotest doubt of there being
unbounded wealth lying within a few feet of them, and they
were determined to reach it by some means or other.</p>

<p>As they stood looking about them, as if in search of something
that would suggest help, the trapper started, and pointed
toward the trees and woods, a short distance away.</p>

<p>“We’ll git in thar,” he said; “it ain’t the time of year fur
bark to peel good, but thar ar’ vines thar.”</p>

<p>The next minute both were running at full speed toward
the trees, where good fortune awaited them. There was found
any quantity of grape-vines, which, by the aid of their knives,
were speedily trimmed into the proper size and length.</p>

<p>They were not as flexible as could be desired, but, with the
assistance of powerful muscles, they could be made to answer
their purpose.</p>

<p>There was considerable to be overcome before they could
hope for success. It was agreed that Teddy should leave his
rifle behind upon the rocks, so as not to be encumbered with
it, while he should grasp the vine in his powerful hands and
lower himself to the table, when he could let go of his support,
and be free to make his explorations. When he chose to ascend
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i> again, he could do so by means of the vine,
as he proposed to use it in descending in the cañon.</p>

<p>All this presupposed the fastening of the upper end of the
vine, as it would be rather a too difficult task for old Stebbins
to act the part of windlass.</p>

<p>By twisting it around a projecting point of the rock, this
was finally accomplished, and then Teddy prepared for his descent.</p>

<p>He let himself carefully over the edge of the chasm, and
the next moment was dangling over the cañon, with the trapper
anxiously watching his movements.</p>

<p>Slowly down, down, sunk the Irishman, until half the distance
was descended, and he looked at his feet to make sure
of reaching their support. Carefully the rough vine slid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
through his hands, until at last he touched the edge of the
table, and believing his support secure, he let go his hold, and
stood at the mouth of the cavern.</p>

<p>As he looked in the twilight of the chasm, he saw something
move, and instantly after, to his unbounded amazement,
discerned two Blackfoot Indians!</p>

<p>“Begorra! but I didn’t dhrame <em>that</em>, either,” he muttered,
as he prepared to defend himself as best he could.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE WONDERFUL CAVERN.</span></h2>


<p>Teddy O’Doherty had no time to wonder how these red-skins
had got there. It was sufficient to know that he was
thrown among them, and that there was no retreat for either
party.</p>

<p>The Irishman anxiously peered into the cavern to see how
many foes he had, but was somewhat relieved to find that he
had but two to combat.</p>

<p>“Begorra! if ye’d only lay aside yer wippons,” he muttered,
“and take yer shillaleh like a Christian mon, I’d wilcome
the chance that threw me in yer way, and as it is,
whoop, hurrah! and come on, and the divil take yees!”</p>

<p>With which he executed a leap in the air, flipping one of
his heels with the flat of his hand, and uttering a defiant
whoop at the same time, as a challenge for his dusky enemies
to advance to the encounter.</p>

<p>The two Indians were without guns, they having laid them
down, no doubt, at some other place, but each possessed his
tomahawk and knife. Teddy had his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cuchillo</i> also in his girdle,
although it had not been left there with any thought that it
would be called into requisition for any such purpose.</p>

<p>Instead of drawing his knife, Teddy placed himself in position,
as though he were some pugilistic champion, with his
fists as his bulwarks.</p>

<p>“Be jabers! if I only had some place to back up ag’inst,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
he muttered, as he glanced over his shoulder. “I have the
other side of this blamed old kinyon, but, as the same is
twinty feet away, I can’t lean against it very well, and at the
same time, there’s little danger of the spalpeens attacking me
in the raar.”</p>

<p>There was that consolation, truly, but Teddy stood in a very
ticklish position, where a slight blow was likely to send him
over the rock into the water below.</p>

<p>The Indians evidently looked upon themselves as masters of
the situation; but, at the same time, they were very wary
about attacking a man to whom such a bellicose attitude
seemed to come very natural.</p>

<p>They made no outcry, but grasping their knives, and fixing
their dark eyes upon the white man, like cats about to pounce
upon their prey, they separated from each other, and cautiously
advanced to the assault.</p>

<p>Teddy was no unskilful pugilist, and he saw that, barring
any accident, he had the advantage of these dusky assassins,
despite the knives in their hands; for they knew nothing at
all of the art of self-defense.</p>

<p>Several feet separated the hostile parties, when the Irishman
made a lightning-like leap, sending out a terrific left-hander at
the same time, “straight from the shoulder,” that, striking the
nose of the astonished red-skin, sent him turning several back-somersaults.</p>

<p>Wheeling with the same extraordinary celerity, he bestowed
a similar compliment upon the other red-skin, and
vigorously following it up, forced him over the edge of the
rock into the cañon below.</p>

<p>Old Stebbins had not been long in detecting that something
was wrong with his friend. He understood what his defiant
whoop meant, and knew that he had dropped into a nest
of Indians.</p>

<p>But how to help him!</p>

<p>There was no possible way open; for, if he should attempt
to descend by means of the grape-vine, he would be
at such a disadvantage that it would be nothing less than
suicide. So he could only hold his rifle ready to seize the
first opportunity that should present itself.</p>

<p>It was not long in coming. When Teddy toppled his man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
over the edge of the rock, he had scarcely reached the water
below, when the sharp crack of the trapper’s rifle rung above
the din of waters, and the miserable red-skin floated away, as
limp and lifeless as the garments upon his person.</p>

<p>“Now, give us another, Teddy!” called out old Stebbins, as
he caught up the other gun.</p>

<p>But there was good reason why the other didn’t
come.</p>

<p>When Teddy turned to seize him, he saw him spring to
his feet, and start backward into the cave with all speed.</p>

<p>“Be jabers, yees can’t run fur in that direction, as me
mither observed whin the piggy run his head into the pratie-pot,”
exclaimed Teddy, as he dashed after him.</p>

<p>But it was impossible for him to take heed to his feet, and he
had taken scarcely a half dozen steps, when a sudden rise in
the floor of the cavern caused him to trip and fall forward,
with no little violence, upon his face.</p>

<p>“Worrah, worrah, but that rock ain’t very soft,” he muttered,
as he picked himself up, and rubbed his bruised countenance.
“Where did that spalpeen go?”</p>

<p>At his first entrance into the cave, he naturally supposed
that it extended backward but a short distance; but he had
already penetrated a hundred feet, and there were no signs
of its ending.</p>

<p>Nor did the light decrease. It was faint; but still, when
the eyes became accustomed to it, sufficient to see one’s surroundings.
Looking ahead, Teddy saw a circular opening,
through which this partial light of day entered.</p>

<p>“Be jabers, but that’s the place where the haythen come in!”
concluded Teddy, as he paused in amazement and looked in
that direction.</p>

<p>And while he thus stood gazing, the opening was darkened
by a moving body, which almost instantly disappeared.</p>

<p>“That’s the rid-skin goin’ out,” rightly concluded the Irishman,
as he hurried along after him.</p>

<p>For fully two hundred feet more, the wondering Teddy
made his way along the subterranean cavern, looking neither
to the right nor the left, but with his eye fixed upon the
light opening, which seemed to shine like a beacon light to
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>When the opening was reached, he unhesitatingly walked
out into the open air, and found himself on the bank of the
stream, very near the point, where he and old Stebbins had
left it.</p>

<p>“This route is much aisier than t’other,” concluded Teddy,
as he looked wonderingly about him, “and I rispict the sinse
of the haythen that used it to come in by.”</p>

<p>Fixing the place in his mind, so that there could be no
mistake about finding it again, he hurried to rejoin his friend.</p>

<p>The trapper, as a matter of course, was intensely excited
and apprehensive. The sounds of the tumult below him,
having suddenly died out, made it appear that Teddy had
“gone under” by the hands of the treacherous Blackfeet.</p>

<p>While he was in this distressing uncertitude, he descried the
Irishman hastening toward him. He raised his hands in
amazement, but before Teddy could speak the trapper comprehended
how the thing had come about.</p>

<p>“You’ve allers been a lucky dog, Ted, ever since we knowed
you,” he remarked, as the Irishman came up; “tell me all
about it.”</p>

<p>It required Teddy but a few minutes to do this in his own
peculiar manner. He related every thing succinctly, from the
moment his feet rested upon the edge of the rock to the
time when he emerged from the cavern by its back door.</p>

<p>“Quaar that the red-skins war thar,” said old Stebbins.
“Thar don’t seem to be many places in this country whar
the varmints ain’t. I wonder what they war doin’ thar?”</p>

<p>“Don’t yees saa it was the <em>goold</em>?” said Teddy, in a low,
delighted voice.</p>

<p>“Did yer take a look ’round and see any of the yaller stuff?”</p>

<p>Teddy slapped his thigh a tremendous thwack.</p>

<p>“I knowed I’d furgot somethin’, as me father obsarved,
whin we missed the corpse of me mither, afther goin’ a mile
to the church widout it. I was so interested in the haythen
that I niver thought of the goold.”</p>

<p>“I’m afeard you won’t find much thar,” said the trapper,
feeling somewhat of a reaction from the high hopes he had entertained.</p>

<p>“<em>It’s there!</em>” was the confident assertion of Teddy. “I
know it; that’s what brought the haythen there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“But they don’t know the valley of gold.”</p>

<p>“They know it’s a handy thing to make ear-rings of, and
that they kin git plenty of powder and lead fur it at the
Forts.”</p>

<p>“Wal, we’ll have to take another look in thar. Shall it be
you or me?”</p>

<p>“Why not both?”</p>

<p>The trapper shook his head.</p>

<p>“Ef it warn’t fur the varmints we might, but they’re too
thick fur as to give ’em a chance to lock us up in thar.”</p>

<p>“Yees are right,” assented Teddy, who saw the prudence of
his companion; “do yees act the part of sintinel, and I’ll take
a betther look at the insides of the cavern.”</p>

<p>This was agreed upon, and the two set out for the bank of
the stream, where the opening occurred. It was found to be
nearly circular in character, like the mouth of an immense
columbiad, so that an ordinary-sized man was compelled to
stoop quite low to enter. The top of the bank projected over
and concealed the orifice, so that there was little danger of
seeing it, unless it was made a special search, or its existence
was previously known.</p>

<p>“Do yer want yer gun?” inquired the trapper, as his friend
was ready to enter.</p>

<p>“No; I kin do betther wid me fists on them spalpeens, ef
there should be any of ’em in there. Do yees mind and not
let any of ’em steal in upon me.”</p>

<p>“Never fear for me.”</p>

<p>With the faithful guard upon the outside, Teddy unhesitatingly
re-entered the cavern, and began his explorations.</p>

<p>The cave in no place was found to be over twenty feet
in width. The bottom was generally level, composed of rock
and hard, dry earth. The sides were the same, the dirt
crumbling beneath the touch like ashes.</p>

<p>Nothing unusual was observed until he had very nearly
reached the scene of his affray with the Blackfeet, and here
something <em>was</em> seen.</p>

<p>Teddy’s heart gave a great bound, and his eyes sparkled, as
he saw that he was really in a golden cave. It was all around
him, beneath his feet, over his head, and on every hand.</p>

<p>It was like a gorgeous dream indeed; so like his night vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
that he kept moving about to make sure that it was not a repetition.</p>

<p>But no; he could see the yellow dust shining everywhere&mdash;that
bright, glittering yellow, the dearest color in existence
to half the world, and which will set nine-tenths of mankind
crazy by the mere sight of it.</p>

<p>At first glance it seemed to Teddy that the gold existed
only in the shape of dust or sand, deposited plentifully around
him; but an examination revealed altogether a different and
curious form of deposit.</p>

<p>Reaching up his hand, to scoop down some of the auriferous
particles, he grasped instead a loose stone that was loaded
with gold; the same thing was repeated until he made the
discovery that it existed alone in that form.</p>

<p>It was as if a rock, nine-tenths of which was pure gold,
had been blown to fragments in the center of the cave, the
pieces burying themselves on every hand.</p>

<p>There was gold everywhere, and in abundance. There
were thousands of dollars, and the trappers had but to secure
it to secure to themselves comfort and opulence for the rest of
their days.</p>

<p>Teddy stood for several minutes in silence, and then he
heaved a great sigh.</p>

<p>“Whin I was at home in ould Ireland, I had two pockets
big enough to thrust in three or four of the goats that war always
wandering about our farm. Ah! if I only had them
pockets now!”</p>

<p>And he ruefully ran his hands as far down in his trowsers
as they would go, and found they would not quite reach his
knees.</p>

<p>“That’s all, and that ain’t half ’nough.”</p>

<p>But he did the best thing possible under the circumstances.
He began gathering the precious nuggets, and continued the
work until his capacious pockets would hold no more, and
there was imminent risk of their bursting with their overload.</p>

<p>Then he filled his hands and began laboring toward the
entrance.</p>

<p>It proved a labor indeed, for the specific gravity of this
precious metal is very great, and it was all he could do to
reach the entrance with his freight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, as may be supposed, the trapper was anxiously awaiting
him. The load was distributed between them, and they
set out on their return. “Headquarters” were reached without
any thing unusual occurring and there they awaited the
coming of Black Tom.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AROUND THE CAMP-FIRE.</span></h2>


<p>There was an interested and anxious group gathered around
the trappers’ camp-fire, on the evening succeeding the adventures
we have narrated.</p>

<p>The three were together, and they had taken all necessary
precautions against danger from the Indians. The entrance
to their underground house had been securely closed by
means of an immense boulder, that was only shoved into position
by means of their united strength, and the fire was kindled
so far back that there was no danger of its being discovered
by any one, not even by looking down the rent through which
the smoke found its way out of the cavern.</p>

<p>The night was quite cool, and they had an abundance of
fuel, so that every provision had been made for their comfort.
They had eaten supper, too, although neither of the three had
much appetite for it.</p>

<p>They were smoking, and, as a matter of course, discussing
the all-absorbing topic of the day. Black Tom was the first
to display his nugget with a triumphant air, which changed
somewhat when old Stebbins produced a still larger one, and
Teddy began to disgorge from what seemed his inexhaustible
pocket.</p>

<p>The entire wealth was emptied into a heap, where the firelight
shone full upon it. The three contemplated it a few
moments, and then removing his pipe, Tom grinned and
asked:</p>

<p>“How many skins and peltries would we have to take
into St. Louey to raise that amount of specie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Several years work,” replied his elder companion.</p>

<p>“Don’t it look purty?” asked Teddy, who was stretched
full upon his face, his fists placed one above the other, while
his chin rested on the uppermost. “Begorra, there ain’t
any thing this side of ould Ireland that would do me eyes
more good. What is it worth?”</p>

<p>This was the question all three had been turning over in
their minds for some time, and each gave the result of his
conjecture.</p>

<p>“I kin hit it purty near,” said Teddy, who was squinting at
it as though it were a target for his rifle. “I was always good
at guessin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” asked Black Tom.</p>

<p>“Five hundred and fifty-four millions, six hundred and
ninety-three pounds starling, more or less.”</p>

<p>The Irishman was in earnest, and it was a long time before
he could be made to believe that he had not gathered in more
than five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>“It’ll foot up that, any way,” said old Stebbins; “and if
we kin keep that up for a few days, it’ll answer.”</p>

<p>“You’re sartin thar’s plenty more thar?” asked Black Tom,
looking toward the Irishman.</p>

<p>“Sartin!” he exclaimed, in amazement; “it’s all over!
There’s tons of it; there’s enough to make mesilf, and all me
grandfathers and grandmothers, as rich as Queen Victoria,
away back to the latest ginerations of posterity.”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy over it,” replied Tom; “thar ain’t half what
you say thar is.”</p>

<p>“Yees jist go wid me to-morrer, and saa fur yersilf.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I will do, ef the infarnal red-skins don’t get
too thick.”</p>

<p>“Or the beast,” suggested old Stebbins.</p>

<p>“Be jabers! but we saad nothing of him,” said Teddy, who
had scarcely thought of the strange animal up to this moment.</p>

<p>“I don’t think <em>he’ll</em> bother us, ef we look out fur him; but
what were them consarned Blackfeet doin’ in thar?”</p>

<p>It was all-important that they should not overlook the personal
danger involved in this matter. The encounter of Teddy
O’Doherty with the Indians proved beyond all doubt that
such a peril existed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Much speculation and conjecture now followed. It was
probable that the Indians had known of the existence of this
gold mine for some time, and no doubt they had turned it to
good account.</p>

<p>One of those nuggets, flecked and imbedded through and
through with the pure gold, would purchase many necessaries
and luxuries for whatever red-skin chose to carry it to a
trading or frontier post. It could be easily manufactured into
the rude trinkets so prized by all native Americans.</p>

<p>Such being the case, it might be considered certain that the
property would be disputed. Had old Stebbins been given the
opportunity to finish, not one, but both the Blackfeet, their
disappearance undoubtedly would be laid to the terrible
“ringed and streaked” creature that was dreaded by white
and red-men alike.</p>

<p>But the prize was worth fighting for, and the three men
were ready and willing to risk their lives for the purpose of
securing what they had labored so hard for during the many
long years of the past.</p>

<p>Teddy proposed that they should visit the cave during the
night, when there was little fear of their being molested, but
the other two were reluctant to make the attempt in the
dark.</p>

<p>The Irishman still urged his point with a vehemence that
bid fair to carry the day, when a noise at the entrance silenced
every tongue.</p>

<p>“Hello in there! can you give a traveler lodging for the
night?”</p>

<p>The voice was recognized as that of Fred Hammond, and
all three instantly sprung to their feet and hurried to the entrance
to admit him. He was regarded with strong friendship
by all, from the unmistakable good will he had manifested
toward them from the beginning.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he joined them round the camp-fire,
and seemed in the best of spirits. Teddy had placed his nuggets,
with no little precipitation, out of sight when Hammond’s
voice was first heard, so that he saw nothing of the real cause
of their conversation.</p>

<p>Scarcely ten minutes had elapsed, when it was palpable to
each of the three trappers that Hammond had been drawn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
their retreat by some extraordinary reason, which would be
speedily made known.</p>

<p>Hammond was so well-bred, and so thoroughly self-possessed,
that he made an easy master of what would have been almost
insuperable to another, and gracefully and in good terms he
came to the point.</p>

<p>“Friends,” said he, looking round in their faces with a
smile, “you are hunters and trappers by profession, but you
came here in search of gold&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And found it,” interrupted Black Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes; I know you stumbled upon a nice little nugget, and
doubtless you all believe there is plenty more of it in this section.”</p>

<p>“Yis,” answered Teddy, with a significance which the
speaker did not get.</p>

<p>“Well, you are right,” added Hammond, with great earnestness;
“there is enough gold within your reach to make you
all rich, and I have come here on purpose to show you where
to find it.”</p>

<p>He paused and looked at them, and they at each other, but
never a syllable was uttered.</p>

<p>“Now,” he resumed, “it may seem that I am not entirely
unselfish in this matter. There is a young lady among the Indian
tribe near at hand, who has consented to accompany me
home, and to become my wife. It was not <em>gold</em> that brought
<em>me</em> here&mdash;it was <em>she</em>; and,” said Hammond, his face aglow
with pleasure, “I have obtained her. Well, we are to start
eastward, on our horses, never to return here. You know, as
well as I, the dangers that beset such a journey, and it’s for
that reason I wish your company.”</p>

<p>“But how kin we go without the spondulicks?” asked
Black Tom.</p>

<p>“I don’t wish you to do so, and therefore I am going to
put you in the way of obtaining all the wealth you want in a
few hours.”</p>

<p>“Would you have told us ef it hadn’t been you wanted us
to take care of yerself and gal?” asked old Stebbins, with considerable
bluntness.</p>

<p>“It is not I that wish to be protected and taken care of,
but Lamora, the lady who accompanies me; but I will answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
your question. When I first saw you in this vicinity and suspected
what you were after, I had not the remotest idea of
imparting to you the secret I had obtained from my lady;
but, when I had seen enough of you to believe that you were
honest men, and deserving of better success, I suggested to
Lamora that we should put you in the way of instantly acquiring
that for which you were so anxiously searching, and
she gave me permission, without a moment’s hesitation, to do
so.”</p>

<p>“That makes it all right,” said Black Tom, much pleased
with the frankness of their visitor; “we’ll shake hands on
that.”</p>

<p>“Yis; that makes things plisent, as me cousin obsarved,
whin he and his gal broke their shillalehs over aich ither’s
heads.”</p>

<p>“I exact only one condition,” said Hammond, “and that is
that you will each and all give me your promise to keep this
matter a secret. It has been long known to the friendly Indians
near at hand, and to some of the Blackfeet, and it is
worth a great deal to them, while, if it should become generally
known among the hunters and trappers, you know this place
would be overrun with lawless men, and the Meagans would
be compelled to leave the home which they hope to keep for
the remainder of their lives.”</p>

<p>The promise was readily given by all, and then Hammond
proceeded to explain with great minuteness the very cavern
which Teddy O’Doherty had explored. The three listened,
until he had finished, and then the Irishman astounded Hammond,
by remarking, with his peculiar chuckle:</p>

<p>“We’re obleeged to you, Misther Hammond, <em>but we’ve
already been thar</em>!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HUNTING WEALTH BY FIRELIGHT.</span></h2>


<p>Yes, Fred Hammond was not a little astounded, as he
learned by what a singular means Teddy O’Doherty had discovered
the cave of wealth, and he listened to the close of
his characteristic narration without interruption. When he
had finished, our hero remarked, with a laugh:</p>

<p>“Then I have all my pains for nothing, since Teddy has
developed such a remarkable genius for dreams.”</p>

<p>“But yer intentions were honorable, as me father remarked,
whin me mither fired the gun at his head, and by mistake
missed him, and therefur we give you credit.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the others, “we’re jist as pleased as though
we had never heard of the cave afore.”</p>

<p>“Thar’s plinty of goold thar, is thar?” continued Teddy,
in his eager way.</p>

<p>“Yes; I have been in the cave more than once, and have
seen that there is an abundance&mdash;far more than you can carry
away with you.”</p>

<p>“And haven’t yer taken any?”</p>

<p>“Not an ounce.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t yees?”</p>

<p>“That for which I was searching,” replied Hammond, with
a smile, “was worth more to me than all the gold in the
Rocky Mountains.”</p>

<p>“Spoken like a thrue lover; jist as I always respictfully
mintioned the name of me love; but doesn’t yees intind to
take any of the yaller stuff wid yer.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I may pick out a few chunks, although I
ain’t particular.”</p>

<p>Teddy now renewed his proposition to search the cavern
at night. They could build a fire within it, and secure all the
gold that was convenient to carry, and by daylight be ready
to start on their homeward journey, while if they waited until
the morrow, they would doubtless have to make a desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
fight with the Blackfeet, and very likely would be driven away
entirely.</p>

<p>There was wisdom in this, and Hammond joined with him,
for, he knew that, if the trappers should be ready on the
morrow to start on their return, Lamora would be prepared
also; and thus, such a proceeding would be entirely in his favor.</p>

<p>And so, after a few minutes more discussion, it was decided
to visit the cave by night.</p>

<p>It was yet comparatively early in the evening, when the four
men issued like so many shadows from “headquarters,” and
noiselessly made their way up the cañon. Teddy and Black
Tom each carried a large pile of faggots on their shoulders, while
the tall stooping form of old Stebbins took the lead, with his
rifle and pick.</p>

<p>The night was quite dark, there being scarcely any moon,
while the sky was swept by numerous dark clouds, that seemed
to indicate that a fierce storm was at no great distance.</p>

<p>They had gone but a short distance, when they paused and
listened. Nothing but the mournful sighing of the wind could
be heard, nor could any indication of danger be detected.</p>

<p>On up through the cañon they made their way&mdash;on up
until they stood on the level prairie, when they turned off and
plunged anew into the wild and rugged recesses of the mountains.
Down again, until they seemed like miners descending
into the bowels of the earth, when they reached the small
stream in which gold had been discovered.</p>

<p>Along this they made their way, with the same noiseless
celerity, no one uttering a word, till all four stood around the
entrance of the gold mine.</p>

<p>Here they compared “notes,” and it was found that not one
had detected any thing suspicious; every thing appeared
auspicious.</p>

<p>Neither Black Tom nor old Stebbins had seen the interior
of the cave, and they were naturally anxious to explore it.
Hammond, therefore, volunteered to act as sentinel, while the
three labored; but, before doing so, all four went in, and
without striking a light, scattered and carefully reconnoitered
the cavern to make sure that no enemies were within.</p>

<p>Everything proving satisfactory, Hammond returned to
his station, and the fire was started. Teddy knew where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to locate it, and when the flame flared up, the eyes of the
hunters sparkled.</p>

<p>“B’ars and bufflers!” exclaimed Black Tom, in a frightened
undertone, as he looked wildly about him, “don’t it beat
every thing?”</p>

<p>“It does that,” assented old Stebbins, whose excitement
was scarcely less; “ef we can tote that home, thar’ll be an
end to our trappin’.”</p>

<p>Teddy threw on the fuel, and the illumination was found
amply sufficient. The yellow nuggets were shining all about
them, and all that they had to do was to gather them.</p>

<p>There was something grotesque and weird in the scene.
The vast, corridor-like cave, lit up by the burning wood&mdash;the
shining glitter of the jagged wall&mdash;the three figures with their
swarthy faces lit up, not by the fire alone, but by the eager
passion that was stirring each heart to its utmost depths&mdash;all
this made up a picture, impressive, unnatural, and almost appalling.</p>

<p>A spell seemed to rest upon the men for a few minutes.
They were so overcome by this palpable evidence of the immense
wealth lying within their reach, that they were forced
to wait for the reaction.</p>

<p>Stepping forward, old Stebbins swung his pick over his
head, and buried its point several inches in the compact earth.
Then, as he forced the handle back, several nuggets dropped
to the ground.</p>

<p>“Pick ’em up,” he called out, in a husky voice, “and I’ll
keep yer busy.”</p>

<p>Teddy and Black Tom gathered up the chunks, and deposited
them in the huge sack, made of bear-skin, that had
been brought for that purpose, while the old hunter plied the
pick with a vigor that amounted to fury.</p>

<p>Only now and then did they speak, for they were swayed
by strange emotions. Old Stebbins seemed literally tireless.
Thump, thump, went his implement, like the throbbing of an
engine. Now and then the fire was struck from the hardened
point, and once it glanced with such violence as to fly from his
hand, and go spinning, end over end, several yards away.</p>

<p>He walked to where it had fallen, and picking it up, without
a word, returned to his labor, and drove it in again, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
chunks and nuggets falling with such continuity that the
others had little time for rest.</p>

<p>The perspiration streaming from his face, and the dust
gathering about his countenance, gave him a strange and
unnatural appearance, such as is noticed upon the faces of the
restrictionists, when engaged at their hideous labor; but
still he toiled on, silent, grim, and determined.</p>

<p>But the old trapper tired at last, and paused so exhausted
that he could scarcely stand, and was unable to resist Teddy
O’Doherty when he took the pick from his hand.</p>

<p>“It comes aisy to me, as I can swing it the same as a
shillaleh.”</p>

<p>His voice sounded like that of another person, and the attempt
at jocularity was terrible from its very ghastliness.</p>

<p>But Teddy swung the pick like a master of the business,
and the fire glanced and flew, as the pieces were chipped off
from the stones and rocks.</p>

<p>At first the work was comparatively easy, but it did not
last long. The pieces were chipped off with greater difficulty,
and were much smaller in size; but they were none the less
rich, and the sack was gradually filled with its auriferous
richness.</p>

<p>The fire was kept burning brightly, and by and by their
task was finished. The three had loaded themselves down
with the ore, until they had all they could hope to carry away
with them.</p>

<p>Their wealth was now in their hands, and it only remained
for them to transport it to where it could be made available.</p>

<p>They ceased from their toil and prepared to return home.</p>

<p>“Afore we go,” said Black Tom, “I’ll take a look outside.”</p>

<p>“What fur?” asked Teddy, in surprise.</p>

<p>“To see whether thar’s any ‘sign.’”</p>

<p>“But Hammond is there, ain’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yas, but there ain’t no telling what mought have tuk place
while we’ve been peggin’ away inside.”</p>

<p>As Hammond was much less experienced in frontier life
than they, the others saw the cause of Black Tom’s misgiving.
The stealthy Blackfeet might have stolen upon him unawares,
and, having silently slain him, as their race had often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
done under similar circumstances, might be lying in wait outside
until the trappers should walk into the ambush.</p>

<p>So it was arranged that old Stebbins and Teddy O’Doherty
should remain where they were, or rather should retreat into
the darkness of the cavern, and await the return of their comrade
from his reconnoissance.</p>

<p>Black Tom moved away with the silence and stealth that had
characterized his approach to an Indian camp, frequently
pausing and listening for some indication of the danger that he
feared menaced them; but nothing reached his ears, save the
dull, faint murmur of the stream behind as it rushed through
its narrow cañon.</p>

<p>It seemed to have lighted up somewhat on the outside since
they had entered the cavern, as he managed to discern the
faint outline of the opening, partly screened as it was by its
peculiar conformation.</p>

<p>“I guess every thing is all right,” he said, as he crept through
the opening.</p>

<p>As he did so, a faint noise caught his ear, and looking
somewhat to the left, he was startled by seeing the dreaded
animal, with its rings and streaks, cantering awkwardly over
the ground, while Fred Hammond was caressing and playing
with it.</p>

<p>“B’ars and bufflers! what does that mean?” muttered the
trapper, who could scarcely believe the evidence of his own eyes.</p>

<p>But such was the case; the dreaded creature, the horrid
beast that was impervious to powder and ball, that crushed in
the skull of a man at one blow, and was literally the terror of
the country, was frolicking with their young friend!</p>

<p>“Come, old fellow, it is time you went home,” suddenly
exclaimed the latter, as he ceased playing, and pointed down-stream.</p>

<p>The unknown obediently turned, and uttering its faint bark,
trotted away, and speedily disappeared.</p>

<p>Black Tom concluded to say nothing of what he had witnessed
to any one. He returned to his waiting friends and
informed them that the way was clear. A few minutes later,
and the three emerged from the cave, and, in the course of half
an hour, safely reached “headquarters,” with their newly acquired
wealth intact.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">BETWEEN TWO CLOUDS.</span></h2>


<p>“Now,” said Fred Hammond, after they had safely reëntered
their own cavern home, “you have made your fortune,
and I suppose are ready to start homeward to-morrow.”</p>

<p>A general assent followed, and Black Tom added that, on
account of the Blackfeet, it was to their interest to get away
without a moment’s unnecessary delay.</p>

<p>“I will be here early in the forenoon with my lady, ready
to accompany you. You will wait for me?”</p>

<p>“Yas; of course.”</p>

<p>And the next moment Hammond had disappeared in the
darkness.</p>

<p>It was only fairly daylight when our hero climbed a small
tree, near the base of a spur of the Black Hills, that commanded
a view of the Meagan village. Carefully concealing
himself from view, he made a waving motion of a branch in
his hand, repeated it several times, intently watching the result,
and then descended to the ground and impatiently
awaited the coming of Lamora.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes had elapsed, when a light step was
heard, and the beautiful girl stepped timidly to view before
him.</p>

<p>The delighted lover rushed toward her and clasped her in
his arms.</p>

<p>“My own loved one!” he exclaimed, as he kissed the white
forehead and pink cheeks, “are you ready to go with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the faint, but immediate reply.</p>

<p>“We are all prepared, and only await your coming.”</p>

<p>After some affectionate love-passages, they began to discuss
their course of action in a sensible, practical manner.</p>

<p>Love had triumphed; Lamora had resolved to leave her
Indian associations forever, and make her home with Hammond
as his wife. That which would have been inexpressibly
sad at any other time, now caused her scarcely a regret; nay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
she was anxious and almost impatient to leave Kipwan, her
adopted father, and the savages who had treated her with such
kind tenderness ever since her childhood.</p>

<p>When Hammond stated the preparations that had been
made for their departure in a few hours eastward, she was
somewhat surprised, but not displeased. She needed some
time herself to get ready, and so, bidding him good-by for the
present, she hastily returned to the village.</p>

<p>She was trembling and excited, for this day marked an era
in her life; but mingling with and permeating this feeling of
uneasiness, was a sweet, happy anticipation as she looked at
the future.</p>

<p>The meaning of her departure was made known only to
Kipwan and his family. These, as a matter of course, were
deeply affected, and the parting was painful in the highest
degree to them. Yet, they interposed no murmur, but parted
under the consciousness that in a few more years they
would be united forever.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the forenoon when Fred Hammond and
Lamora, mounted on their horses, rode down the cañon, side
by side, to the spot where they had promised to meet the
trappers.</p>

<p>They found Black Tom and old Stebbins there, but Teddy
was absent. After Lamora had been made acquainted with
them, the former said:</p>

<p>“Teddy has gone after the animiles, and it’s ’bout time he
war back. I’ve been out ’round the country rackynoiterin’,
and have been back more nor half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Did you discover anything suspicious?” asked Hammond.</p>

<p>“Wal, not <em>particklerly</em> so; thar’s red skins, and plenty of
’em ’round, and every minute we stay h’ar is so much the worse
fur us.”</p>

<p>Old Stebbins had prepared a meal, of which he politely invited
Lamora and Hammond to partake. The former declined,
as she had eaten before leaving her Indian friends.
The latter dismounted and made a hearty breakfast, while
they were awaiting the coming of Teddy and the horses.</p>

<p>The appearance of the beautiful Lamora was the occasion
of no little wonder and interest to the two hunters; they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
heard of her so often, and always in such a way, that they
had come to look upon her as something almost supernatural,
as invulnerable, in some respects, as the dreaded animal that
had caused them so much terror.</p>

<p>Yet they were naturally gallant at heart, and gave no indication,
of what was almost awe, that agitated them, as they
gazed upon her wonderfully beautiful face and figure, as she
sat quietly upon her fiery little pony and awaited the action
of her cavaliers.</p>

<p>While Hammond was within the cavern, making his breakfast,
she chatted with the rough prairie men in a way that
delighted them. They forgot the ever-present and increasing
danger from the Blackfeet and the unknown animal; they
failed to think upon the immense wealth that had so suddenly
come into their hands. They only saw and heard the wonderful
girl, as she sat on her horse, and held them spell-bound
by the charm of her words and manner.</p>

<p>The precious nuggets that had been taken from the cavern
on the preceding night, had been secured in different sacks,
and were ready to be placed upon the backs of the animals,
as soon as they should come. As their work in that line
was now finished, they decided to leave their picks, shovels, and
implements behind, so as not to be incumbered with any thing
that was not really necessary.</p>

<p>Soon Hammond came out and stood beside his horse, and
joined in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Do you feel any alarm about Teddy?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No,” was the somewhat hesitating response of Tom.</p>

<p>“But if he don’t come powerful soon,” added old Stebbins,
“I’m gwine to start on a hunt for him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the horses have wandered some distance away,”
suggested Hammond.</p>

<p>“That’s jest the trouble; thar’s so many hundred things
that might keep him, that thar ain’t no guessin’ the right
one.”</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked Lamora, pointing up the cañon.</p>

<p>“That’s Teddy now.”</p>

<p>So it proved; the Irishman was discerned, on the back of
one of the cantering horses, and leading two others that seemed
very frisky and lively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>As they came near, it was noticed that Teddy’s face was
very red, as though he were perspiring, and it was evident that
he was about as angry as he could possibly be. He had a
horse on either side of him, each held by halters that were
twisted around his respective wrists.</p>

<p>The horse on the right had a habit of holding suddenly back, or
starting spasmodically forward, that threatened to jerk the
rider off his own animal; but as, at the critical juncture, the
other horse gave a yank in the other direction, this catastrophe
was prevented.</p>

<p>This kept Teddy upon his beast, but, at the same time, it
was not pleasant to have the shoulders so nearly dislocated.
As the only thing possible under the circumstances, he made
furious and repeated attempts to kick the playful animals, but
they seemed to know enough to keep out of his reach, and
had a high opinion of the sport.</p>

<p>The fact was, they had been living in “clover” for the last
few days, and they “felt their condition.” They enjoyed it.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Whoa, there!</span>” shrieked Teddy, as he threw his body
back, and grew still redder in the face, and the horses flung
up their heads and laughed, so far as it is possible for an
equine to smile. “Ef I only had my shillaleh, I’d break your
heads! Whoa, there, ye spalpeens!”</p>

<p>It was amusing to the witnesses of these maneuvers, as the
animals came prancing forward, and finally settled to rest in
front of the party.</p>

<p>“What kept you so long?” asked Black Tom, as he and
old Stebbins advanced and took charge of their respective
horses.</p>

<p>“The ould boy got in them!” he replied, puffing from his
severe exertions. “When I cotched one, the ithers give me
the slip and got away, and then when I cotched them, the
ither jumped over me head, kicked me over, and so the spalpeens
kept at it, till I was nearly dead.”</p>

<p>“But you succeeded at last,” laughed Hammond.</p>

<p>“Succaded I did,” replied Teddy, as he wiped off his perspiring
forehead; “begorra, it was the greatest succiss of me
life, as me uncle remarked whin he was thransported to Botany
Bay. Arter I cotched ’em, I jumped on the back of mine,
and wint to shtrappin’ the shtraps around me wrists, whin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
afore I could finish, Black Tom’s horse r’ared back and pulled
me off one side, and as soon as I got on, old Stebbins’ animal
yanked me off t’other, and so it wint. Begorra! ef they didn’t
stand and grin at me&mdash;hilloa!”</p>

<p>For the first time Teddy observed the presence of a lady.
He paused abruptly, and looked quite embarrassed.</p>

<p>Hammond introduced him to Lamora, and the Irishman
bowed with the natural gallantry of his race, and expressed
his pleasure at meeting her, while she seemed quite pleased at
the eccentricity of the Irishman.</p>

<p>There were but few preliminaries. The golden ore was
carefully distributed among the three horses of the trappers,
so that none was compelled to carry overweight, and in a few
minutes all were mounted and ready to proceed.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Black Tom and old Stebbins should
take the lead, while Hammond and Lamora, side by side,
should ride next, and Teddy should bring up the rear. This
was soon understood, and the company started.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that they were down in a deep, dry
cañon, with high, precipitous cliffs and rocks upon either
hand.</p>

<p>This cañon was followed up until it diverged from the other,
when the hunters kept on, with the purpose of reaching the
open, elevated prairie, at the point where the cañon properly
began. This would bring them out near the base of the Black
Hills, and after making their way for a short distance over a
rugged country, they would then reach the rolling plain, with
a free, open road toward the United States.</p>

<p>They reached the point of junction, and turned to the right,
all riding on a walk, for they did not feel like hurrying until
they had full opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>Naturally all were in exuberant spirits, and they were chatting
with each other, and laughing at the jokes of Teddy
O’Doherty. They had gone several hundred yards beyond the
bifurcation of the cañon, and a gradual rise in the ground was
perceptible, when Black Tom and old Stebbins suddenly drew
their horses back on their haunches with a sudden imprecation.</p>

<p>“Look!” exclaimed Lamora, her face pale with excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Following the direction of her finger, Hammond saw the
cañon literally swarming with Blackfeet Indians! They were
all mounted, and had completely blocked up the way in front
of them.</p>

<p>“It’s no go thar!” exclaimed Black Tom, as he wheeled
his horse about. “Turn about and dash down the <em>kenyon</em>, and
ride fur life, fur we’re in a bad fix.”</p>

<p>“See there!” gasped Lamora again.</p>

<p>All paused, transfixed with horror; for their retreat was
blocked up by full as many Indians as was their advance!
They were inextricably hemmed in!</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>


<p>It was an appalling situation indeed. There were fully
thirty mounted and fully-armed Indians in front of them, not
one less in their rear, and on the right and left rose the perpendicular
sides of the cañon to a hight of forty feet!</p>

<p>What was to be done?</p>

<p>The trappers had been in many fearful situations, and had
passed through more than one frightful experience, but they
had never been placed where they were so completely cut off
from human help as now. No one could see a ray of hope.</p>

<p>Black Tom was the first to speak. As the group huddled
together, staring affrightedly at the hideously painted miscreants
that had ambushed and so completely outwitted them,
he said, in a voice that was without tremor or quiver,
“B’ars and bufflers! this is what I call rough!”</p>

<p>“Is there no hope?” asked Hammond.</p>

<p>“I don’t see the first shadow.”</p>

<p>“Let’s set up a Tipperary screech and charge right down
through them,” said Teddy O’Doherty, who clenched his lips,
and meant every word he uttered.</p>

<p>“Can’t we do it?” asked Hammond, who saw in the daring
proposition of the Irishman, the forlorn but the only hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“There ain’t no more chance of doin’ that,” replied the
trapper, “than thar is of ridin’ our horses up them forty feet
of rocks, that ar’ as straight up and down as the side of a
house. Ain’t that so, Steb.?”</p>

<p>“As true as Gospel,” replied the old man, looking fixedly
at the red-skins.</p>

<p>“In the name of heaven, then, what is to be done?” demanded
Hammond, in desperation.</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” was the reply of Tom, who had something
of the Indian stoicism in the presence of the inevitable.
“I ax only one thing.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“That I could say good-by to the old woman and little
ones at home afore I go under,” he answered, as he drew his
hand across his eyes; “but it’s no use.”</p>

<p>“Lamora,” said Hammond, suddenly turning toward the
fair girl, “what will become of <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>“I do not think they will harm <em>me</em>,” she replied. “I am
known to many, and will probably be restored to Kipwan
after&mdash;”</p>

<p>“After we are dead.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, don’t say that,” she said, with a quivering lip.</p>

<p>“But you see no hope for <em>us</em>?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“And there is for you; thank heaven for that!” was the
fervent exclamation of the young lover. “Lamora, the future
was all sunshine to us, but the night has come sooner than
we expected. Go back to your Indian friends again, for, after
I am gone, you will find none so faithful. Bear me in remembrance,
and I shall await your coming from the other
shore.”</p>

<p>“Don’t&mdash;don’t,” plead the poor girl, bravely striving to
keep up.</p>

<p>“Keep near me, Lamora, for when my last moment comes,
as come it must, let my last glance be fixed upon <em>you</em>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” she wailed, “or you will break my heart.”
The Blackfeet took the matter quite leisurely. They had
the whites in their power, and they indulged in a few
whoops, by way of giving vent to their exultation, but still
they made no immediate demonstration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is no need of standing here,” said Hammond, a
few minutes later, “huddled together like a parcel of sheep,
waiting to be shot down. Can one not make terms with
them?”</p>

<p>“What’ll you offer?” was the pertinent response of old
Stebbins.</p>

<p>“Suppose I go forward, and voluntarily surrender the
whole party, what then?”</p>

<p>“If its any enj’yment to you, yer kin do it. Them Blackfeet
ain’t used to that kind of business, and bein’ as we bored
a hole in one of ’em yesterday, I don’t think it’s likely they’ll
think this ar’ a good time to begin; howsumever&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hello! something is up!” exclaimed Hammond. “What
does that mean?”</p>

<p>The Blackfeet who had so suddenly cut off their advance
were now seen in the greatest consternation. They were
shrieking, yelling, leaping from their horses, tumbling over
each other&mdash;all wild and frantic to get out of the cañon!
There seemed to be something in the very center of them
that was like an exploding bombshell, and that caused all this
panic.</p>

<p>While the whites were gazing spell-bound, they suddenly
discerned the cause. A huge body, ringed and spotted in
that unmistakable manner, was plunging among them, uttering
short, sharp barks, while in the space of half a minute
not a Blackfoot remained! Every one had fled!</p>

<p>“It is Jerval! it is Jerval!” exclaimed Lamora, as she descried
the creature. “He has not forgotten me! thank heaven!”</p>

<p>The brute seemed to hear her voice, and came lumbering
down the cañon toward her.</p>

<p>“B’ars and bufflers!” growled Black Tom, looking uneasily
about him, “I don’t fancy <em>you</em> any more than the other varmints.”</p>

<p>“He won’t harm you,” said Lamora; “he is my pet.”</p>

<p>“And mine, too, as the gals always remarked whin they sot
eyes on me,” added Teddy. “I allers liked that critter, and
now I <em>love</em> him. Come here, let me embrace yees.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Jerval!” called out Lamora, pointing down the
cañon toward the other Blackfeet; “drive them away, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>But they had caught sight of the hideous creature, and
they waited for no further driving, but went tearing down the
cañon, with the speed of the wind.</p>

<p>“Now, out of hyar, afore they kin cotch us ag’in!” exclaimed
Black Tom; “let’s git on the open prairie as quick as lightning.”</p>

<p>The horses were put to their full gallop, and a few seconds
later stood upon the high, level ground, free from all threatened
peril. The Indians had vanished with such precipitous haste
that not one of them was in sight.</p>

<p>Our friends halted a few seconds, while Jerval came plunging
up the cañon after them. When he had fairly reached them,
and began frisking around Lamora in his awkward way, Hammond
dismounted, and said, addressing the three trappers:</p>

<p>“Before we leave this part of the country forever, let me explain
a mystery to you. You have, like hundreds of others,
been terrified about this wonderful animal, and I myself have
heard many of the marvelous stories told about him. Let me
say, however, that he has never killed a man, and never can,
for he has not the ability, at least, when he appears in this
shape&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What!” interrupted Black Tom; “do yer mean to say that
he never chawed up nobody?”</p>

<p>“Never,” laughed Hammond; “look here.”</p>

<p>Stooping down, he busied himself for a few moments about
the legs and body of the animal, and then uncovered him, and
there stood before the astounded gaze of the trio a large Newfoundland
dog, that instantly testified its vitality by attempting
to leap up to Lamora, to receive her caresses.</p>

<p>While the trappers continued gazing in silent amazement,
Hammond continued:</p>

<p>“Some years ago, when the Meagan Indians located in this
section, they discovered the presence of gold about them. Knowing
this was liable to be found by the hunters that were constantly
going back and forth through this section, they hit upon
an ingenious expedient. Kipwan, the chief, had been given a
young, intelligent Newfoundland dog by a trader, and, knowing
the superstitions of the hunters and Indians, he got up this
animal, which was made altogether different from any thing
that had ever been heard of before. Making a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
hides of buffaloes and wolves into a cloak or coat that fitted the
figure of the dog, he painted the outside in this fantastic manner,
and then let him run. It was a serious matter for the dog
at first, as he came near smothering to death, and could hardly
carry his armor around with him; but Kipwan, who is as ingenious
as a Yankee, improved on the model, and finally made
it as easy upon the canine as an overcoat upon an ordinary man.
It was made so that he could breathe easily; but the dried, tough
hide was perfectly bullet-proof, except, perhaps, in front of the
eyes. It made the dog awkward and lumbering in his movements,
and perfectly powerless to do harm. Encased in this
shield, he could not harm a rabbit. Jerval, as he was called,
seemed to know by instinct what was required of him. He
roamed around the country, generally through the night, returning
to Kipwan in the morning, when his overcoat was removed,
and he looked like himself until nightfall again. Occasionally,
when necessary, he was sent out reconnoitering
through the day, but not often. It was not long before every
Indian and trapper who saw and did not know him, was
cracking away at him; but, as none of the bullets could
penetrate his skin, Jerval paid little attention to it. When it
became known that he was bullet-proof, the exaggerated stories
that you have heard began, and he infused such terror that he
has long played the part of protector to the Meagans, and you
saw a few minutes ago what he accomplished in putting the
Blackfeet to flight, when he was perfectly powerless to injure a
hair of their heads.”</p>

<p>The trappers gathered around and examined the “armor”
more critically. It was most ingeniously constructed, and must
have been excessively uncomfortable to the dog, when worn
for any length of time. Indeed, it was observed, as a natural
result, that most of the long, shaggy hair had fallen from his
natural body.</p>

<p>When all were satisfied, Hammond carefully placed the armor
upon the Newfoundland, securing it by thongs at the throat,
belly and legs, and then, at a word from Lamora, he went
lumbering off toward his home, where we take our farewell of
him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The homeward journey was begun, and, although no little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
danger was encountered, yet the States were reached in safety,
with their golden treasure intact. Here, when the precious
ore was disposed of, an amount was received which made the
trappers comfortable for the rest of their days, and terminated
the necessity of their continuing the dangerous calling that two
of them had followed so many years. Teddy O’Doherty married
a buxom young lass from Tipperary, and became a well-to-do
farmer in Kansas, he and his former comrades living near together,
and keeping their secret regarding the “Mystery of the
Cañon,” long after they had good reason to know that, in the

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
